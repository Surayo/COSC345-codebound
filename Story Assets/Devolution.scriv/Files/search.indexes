            <Text>[1.1.2]You turn over in bed, drowsy and only half conscious. It’s not unusual for you to wake up in the middle of the night. Your sister is a restless sleeper so you drift, listening to the sounds of her moving on the other side of the room. 

You hear her light boot-steps as she moves closer to the two mattresses on the floor that serve as your beds. 

You feel her looming over you and stir, confused. A rough hand covers your mouth and you snap awake.

            <Text>[3]”What the fuck, Eve!?” you shout. “I can’t believe you’ve done this. After all we’ve been through together.”

“You know this [Xoy], Eve?” the tall man directs to Eve. 

Her eyes haven’t left yours but she ignores your shouted question to answer his. “Yeah I do, Rasputin. [Name]’s my shitty little [Xther].” Her shock has turned to disgruntled annoyance.

“Oi!” you shout, marching towards the group, your knife gripped tight in in the hand still hidden in your pocket.

“Piss off!” Eve yells back, finally breaking eye contact to turn her back on you in dismissal.


[C3.1]You pull the knife on Eve and aim for the throat in a blind sweep of rage.

[C3.2]You pull the knife on Eve, but hesitate. She’s your sister. No mater what she’s done she won’t stop being your sister.

[C1]You fuck off, seething. It isn’t worth causing a scene here. There are too many Vagabonds for you to win this fight.</Text>

            <Text>[1.2]”OK.” You say rubbing a hand down your face. How do you even begin to address what your sister had done. “I saw you with the rebels today…” you glance up at her. “Bad choice on your part I’m afraid.”


She chuckles weakly and looks away. “Yeah. Well… Staying at the factory is the shittier option. It hurt me to work there - it’s hurting you! Look at you, you’re falling asleep as we talk.” You straighten your spine and try to look more awake from where you were slumped down in your seat. Eve frowns at your apparent recovery. “Do you have any idea how much better I’m feeling? I get to sleep!”

“I sleep-” you say.

“-for more than a shitty fist-full of hours. I get actual restful deep sleep for more than a couple days in a row. When has The Fucking Factory ever done that for you, little [Xther]?”

You dismiss her words with a shake of your head. “Wait. How long have you even been hanging around with these fucks?” You vaguely recall noticing her absence at home a few times but you’re normally too tired to think about dinner let alone something as strenuous as contemplating the absence of someone who isn’t even there.


“A couple weeks now.” Eve says, not ashamed in the slightest. “They asked me to join, actually, after they heard about my Aspect. Which, I don’t know why they’re interested in that. It only makes me immune to toxins.” You frown more and more as she continues talking. “They must be trying to get out of the city or something? Get past the Bioforms? Honestly I don’t really give a shit as long as they keep letting me live in their bunker.”


“You’d sell your soul for anything wouldn’t you.” You mutter mostly to yourself, leaning back in your chair so far you can no longer see her.

You hear Eve stand. “Yeah, well, hit me up when you want to feel alive again. I’m done working for that shit fuelled factory. I’m out. And I’m never going back.” She walks away from that table.

You fume for a second as Eve starts gathering her stuff from around the room. You don’t understand why she can trust them when everything they’re doing goes against the greater good. By not working in The Factory the Vagabonds just put their share of the work onto everyone else. 

The factory protects everyone and the Vagabonds should know that. Eve should know that! The heavy smog it pumps into the air day in and day out forms a powerful chemical barrier against the Bioforms native to this planet. If it weren't for The Factory all of Fragos, your safe-haven in the forest, would have been slaughtered with the rest of the world in the Bioforms’ first attack.

And your sister is just thinking of her beauty sleep. Typical. 

She stops behind you where you are still slumped over the table. “You could join us.” She says, her tone cautious and hopeful.

“You could shut up.” You reply, voice muffled from where your face is pressed into your arm. 

She doesn’t say anything else, just drops something on the table with a clank, and before long the door is clicking closed behind her.

Sitting on the table is the ring you gave her her first day in The Factory.


[C1.1.1]You can’t let her do this. You slap yourself to back awake and pull yourself back to your feet. Then before you can second guess your sudden resolve you run out into the night to look for Eve.

[C1.1.2]She can look after herself for one night. You pull yourself to your feet just long enough to strip your uniform off and crawl into bed. You are so tired.

[C1.1.3]Sleep drags your eyes back closed. You fall asleep at the table.</Text>

            <Text>[2]Eve opens her mouth to reply to you then clamps it shut, glancing at the tall man. Did he force her to join? He looks between you and her. “A friend, is it Eve?”

“My [XTHER] actually.” Eve replies but she isn’t looking at him, she’s looking at you. You don’t know what your face is doing right now but it incites her into saying, “I’m sorry, [NAME]. You wouldn’t understand. The Vagabonds aren’t trying to hurt anyone.”

“Of course we aren’t, Eve. That you even feel the need to state it-” He looks at you. It’s about at that time that you remember that these Vagabonds have committed an unknown number of atrocities against your city. You tense, taking your eyes from Eve’s to meet his. “Ah, but of course. [NAME] was it? I don’t think we’ve met before. I go by Rasputin, myself. I won’t presume your sister has had the forethought to tell you but I am the leader of the Vagabonds.”

Oh Fuck. The Leader. “Oh - ah. Right. Right.” You gulp. What are you still doing here? Your eyes flick back to your sister, looking for an explanation. 

“[NAME].” Eve says, “I should have told you, I know, but it’s not like I didn’t try. You have always been so stuck up on working in that shitty fucking Factory-” Rasputin raises his hand and your sisters mouth clicks shut immediately. 

“It must have come as a shock, your sister joining our group.” A cramp has developed in your left calf from standing tense for so long. You dare not move. “I know how we must seem from the outside. You must think that by working in The Factory you are protecting everyone in the city who can’t work themselves. Yet the Vagabonds can work yet choose not to.”

If he knows why he’s wrong then why is he still doing it. “I don’t understand. Every time a worker leaves The Factory the other workers have to pick up their slack. We can’t keep doing this. It’s killing us. If you understand this, why then? Why are you doing it?” you ask. If he knows why you hate the Vagabonds, if he knows why you think they are scum who turned against their own people, then why?

“Our actions aren’t without cause. We are the rebellion as you rightly know. But do you know who we are rebelling against?” You had always thought they were against working in The Factory. That they were lazy and selfish and would rather have an easy life without toil and pain than protect their people. 

You glance from one face to another and spot another familiar face in the crowd. Rush. An older guy who used to work alongside you at the furnaces. He had been hard-working and committed to keeping your city alive. Rush had been a guiding force in your early days of working in the factory after your parents’ deaths.

Rush had disappeared one day. He never said anything before he was just gone. It had been a crushing blow.

You don’t know what he’s rebelling against, or what bought your sister over to the Vagabonds side.

Rasputin speaks again. “There is good reason we rebel.”


[C2.1]”Explain it to me then.” You say. Rasputin nods, satisfied and motions for you to follow him. You follow.

[C2.2]”Everyone has to work. It’s the only way to keep the Bioforms out of the city. You need to stop this.” You say

[C2.3]You look at Eve. “Please, come back home. You shouldn’t be doing this no matter what fucked up reasons they’ve given you to make you think it’s OK.”

            <Text>[1.1]Your sister appears in the doorway looking as angry as you are. She opens her mouth to retort but you aren’t finished. “Dad didn’t work his fucking bones to the ground for you to skive off work to go hang out with rebel scum like them. Did you even fucking stop to consider who you were hurting?” 

“You don’t know what you’re talking about, [NAME]. Do you even have any idea who I was with!? No. Of course not. You don’t think.”

“Yes I fucking do. You’re the one-”

She stomps over to where you are sitting at the table, hands fisted. “Shut your shitting mouth, no you don’t. The vagabonds aren’t the bad guys!”

You groan and thump your head down on the table. “Why do you have to be like this. Can’t you just sit down and shut up for once in your life. Working in the The Factory protects us and the Vagabonds refuse to work. Them not working just makes it harder for the rest of us.” 

“The Factory is a shit-hole” She mutters. 

“We would die if it wasn’t for the factory!” You say. She rolls her eyes at your words and pushes her glasses further up her nose.

“That’s what they want you to think,” She says smugly. What. What does that even mean? “Well I’m not going back. I’m going to get out of this shitty town and when I do I’ll never have to work in that dump-hole ever again.” She extends her middle finger towards you.

It makes your blood boil. How can she refuse to work knowing what’s out there and knowing that The Factory protects you from it? You pull her down by the arm so her face is close to yours, “You are going to work tomorrow.” You say, voice low and careful. She stares back at you, defiant, matching you stare for stare before she rips her arm out of your grip.

“Never again.” she says. Then she walks over to her bunk and starts pulling things into a backpack.

You groan again and thump your head back down on the table. Sometimes you just want to wrap your hand around your sister’s neck and strangle her until she listens to you.

You’re so tired. You should probably haul yourself off to bed and leave her to ruin her own life. 

Eve stomps around the small space picking up the few items she owns that are scattered around. You watch her progress from where you’re still slumped across the table. The only furniture in the room is you and your sisters beds and a table with two mismatched chairs. It doesn’t take her long to gather up her few possessions but in that short span of time your eyes droop anyway.

You are half asleep again by the time she steps up behind you and you hear a clink of something dropping onto the table. Then before you can do more than lift your head she has sweept out of the room and back out into the night.

You sit up and stretch the crick out of your back. The empty silence of the room seeps into your tired limbs. On the table is a simple ring, one of your sister’s. 

It’s the ring you gave her as a gift when she started her first day in The Factory.


[C1.1.1]You can’t let her do this. You slap yourself to back awake and pull yourself back to your feet. Then before you can second guess your sudden resolve you run out into the night to look for Eve.

[NAME] - Name of the main character
[VNAME] - Name of the villain
[RNAME] - Name of the rival/counterpart
[XE] - He and she
[XER] - him and her
[XIS] - his and her
[XERS] - hers and his
[XSELF] - himself and herself
[Xther] - brother and sister



Your name is [NAME] and you are on a train. This is the first time you have been on a train and you clutch at the train ticket in your pocket as the scenery outside the window speeds past. It was a lucky find, the ticket. You spotted it on the pavement on your walk home. 



The force of the attach flips you over and your head hits the ground hard. Your ears ring.



The air is heavy with smog and the streets are cracked and filthy. (Blah, blah, blah - setting up disopian town.) You are walking home from work. You work in the factories. Everyone in this town works in the factories. The days are grueling and by the time you make it home, you will barely have the energy to eat and sleep before you have to do it all over again. It’s all you can do to put one heavy boot in front of the other as you autopilot your way home. You are exhausted after a 12-hour shift at the coal furnaces. 


Suddenly twelve Vagabonds round the corner - (The Vagabonds are a rebel gang who refuse to work in the factories like the rest of you) and in amongst them, you spot a familiar face. It's your sister Josie. 


Decision - 
1. Don’t make eye contact with your sister. Pretend you didn’t see her. You just want to get home and it's not worth the trouble confronting her here.
2. You get angry. What does she think she’s doing joining those rebel scum. You start shouting at her and pull out your flick knife.
3. You stop and stare at her in shock. What is she doing with them? The group of Vagabonds notice you and advance. Most people know better than to stare.


Notes on the three options. 
1. you confront your sister at home. You try and convince her to leave the gang. She tries to convince you to join them
2. You start a fight with the rebels (leads to your potential death or getting on the gang's bad side)
3. the rebels and your sister try to recruit you to their gang. The leader explains why they are rebelling against the wealthy overlords


Weapons factory - produce guns and munitions 
        Gang trying to take over, rebel?


Sister - Eve. Likes jewelry. Always had rings and chains and additions to her uniform where [NAME] never did. Kind of over the top dramatic about things. Defensive and clingy in her relationships. Wears large round glasses that don't have lenses. Brazen and competent. Older sister? - fact check this.


Leader - Rasputin (real name: Steven). Mysterious but kind. Has a sense of power and authority but doesn’t look like it. Very articulate with his vocabulary and very skilled at manipulation. Has manipulated the Vagabonds by bending the truth and convincing them to follow him. Uses sister to get close to the main character. Slight fanatic. (watch high sparrow)

Drew - bangs on the doors of the house. 

Liaba - friend of Eve and [NAME]. Possible romance?

Rush - “An older guy who used to work alongside you at the furnaces.”

Greg - kidnapper
Patrick - kidnapper
Boss - attacker, lead kidnapper woman

            <Text>[1.1.1]You can’t let her do this. You slap your face to try and startle yourself back awake then stumble back to your feet. Before you can second guess your sudden resolve you head out into the streets to look for Eve.

It’s fully dark out and a harsh chill has settled over the town center. You must have been asleep at the table for longer than you thought. 

You shiver and pull your work coat closer around yourself and peer both ways down the street. To the left lies the Factory, you know that path like the unwavering aftertaste of canned Nutritious Food Staple. To the right lies deeper parts of the Fringes, crumbling skyscrapers and the sprawling roads of a city long abandoned. 

Which way did she go?
 

[C1.1.1.1]You quickly pull yourself together and run to the left towards The Factory. Eve will be headed towards the Vagabonds and that is near where you saw them last.

[C1.1.1.2]You turn to the right. From how rarely you’ve ever seen the Vagabonds they must operate far away from the usual paths to The Factory.

[C1.1.1.3]You can’t decide where to go. You glance left and right and feel the familiar pull of exhaustion drag at you.

            <Text>There was a stretch of history where Humans were the most powerful beings on Dirth. They had magic on their side that Dirth had never seen before - the power of their Aspects. And when that failed they developed technology.

The humans adapted faster than anything before. They thrived.

Most of the human inhabitants of Dirth have been wiped out long ago. Death came suddenly and neither their Aspects nor their science could save them. 

They were poisoned. For Humans were not the first beings to claim this world and once, before the humans came, the Bioforms ruled.

By the time the people realised the Bioforms were hostile it was too late. It was a pandemic engineered by the native species of Dirth that few humans could survive.

But some did survive. Around the world there were clusters of people who had been protected by the onslaught of this worlds flora and fauna by the most unlikely of sources; smog. The largest densest most industrial cities clung to survival as the rest of the world’s population were gassed.

In these cities nature had been pushed out by the dense polluting air and crowded spaces. These cities had defended themselves against the Bioforms before they even knew the Bioforms were a threat. Dense polluting air, crowded spaces - no Bioform could survive here and so when the time of the slaughter came nothing was here to attack.

Still, even in these cities, few survived. 

Time passed for the survivors and the remaining people of Dirth clustered together in their protective cities, for outside those walls were the Bioforms. In this game of adaptation only time would tell who would survive.  

//Your name is [Name] and you are walking home from work. The air is heavy with smog and the streets are cracked and filthy. Dust clings to your drab work clothes as it always does - a remnant of The Factory. It’s the end of another grueling shift and after twelve long hours in front of the furnaces it’s all you can do to put one foot in front of the other. 

Your route home takes you through The Fringes - an abandoned part of this sprawling city you call home. It’s quiet. This isn’t the part of your city that your people are allowed to occupy but if the odd shadow or creek disturbs your walk you never stop to acknowledge it. It’s better to just keep your head down and get home.

A heavy cloud of exhaustion has settled over you like the familiar old blanket that greets you at the end of every work day. Except instead of comfort it’s weight carries with it only bone weary dread. This is just another day in an endless stretch of days. You sigh. 

A rustle of noise. A shadow shifts out of your peripheral vision. You are suddenly very alert. Somehow you manage not to stop even as you get closer to the source. Another quiet noise - this one almost sounds like a muffled echoey bark. It came from the alley up ahead, a side path that leads to deeper parts of the city. Sprawling underground structures and streets no worker like yourself ever walks down. 

You peer into the gloom but see nothing. If that was voices you heard it’s bad news for you. Only outcasts and rebels spend any time in these streets. Maybe you should take another route home. 

You hear that muffled noise again, loader and more distinct. Definitely voices. You hardly have time to freeze before a group of people walk out into the smog filtered daylight. 

Vagabonds. They are Vagabonds. All of them. You know this immediately by the black stained clothes of their crew. The Vagabonds are a group of self proclaimed outcasts who refuse to work in the Factory. They have rebelled and they scare the fuck out of you.

This time you stutter to a stop. Shit. This is a bad place to be caught. Your eyes flick from one face to another as they saunter out of the alley. More than a dozen Vagabonds and one of you. Icy fear flows down your spine. They’re rebels, no one knows exactly how dangerous they are but from the stories you’ve heard they are vicious in their cause. 

Most of them don’t even glance your way. You grip the handy flick knife in your pocket and avoid the eyes of the trailing two Vagabonds who are jostling each other and pointing at you frozen in place. 

A tall sort of gaunt looking Vagabond glances at you. “On your way, worker.” he says, his words barely louder than the banter of the crew around him. Tense but relieved, You go to duck your head down and do as he says but a pair of familiar circular glasses eclipsing shocked wide eyes stop you. 

It can’t be. Your sister.

What is Eve doing?


[C1]There is no point provoking this gang of bastards. You catch and hold your sisters eye before you turn around and walk away. There is always another route home.

[C2]”Eve?” You say, your sister tenses up as you call her out, “What are you doing with them?” The tall man who addressed you glances back at her, expression faintly curious. 

[C3]That fucking shit-head. What the hell is Eve doing with a bunch of traitorous rebels? Your hand clenches down on the flick knife in your pocket.</Text>

            <Text>[1]By the time you make it home you are shaking and weary from your encounter with The Vagabonds. Exhaustion drags at you and as you slump through the door your bed in the far corner of the room looks oh so inviting. 

But you are also starving and so redirect your efforts to scarfing down some canned Nutritious Food Staple. The action of sitting upright and eating takes the rest of the post work wind out of you and so you let your eyes drift closed right there at the table. 

The sound of the front door clicking shut startles you out of your doze. Soft padding steps pass through the front hall. You blink the fog out of your eyes and rub at your slightly aching jaw. Lying sprawled out over the table isn’t the best position to fall asleep in.

 “Eve?” you call out, your voice croaky from misuse. 

The footsteps stop and a quiet “Shit” breaks the stillness of the house. Yep. That’s your sister, alright. “Go back to sleep.” her harsh whisper calls back to you.


[C1.1]”Don’t tell me to go to sleep. I saw you with those fucking Vagabonds. What were you thinking?” You say back angrily, your voice still low and hushed.

[C1.2]”Come in here for a second. We need to talk” You say instead. Her head pokes into the room before she creeps inside to sit next to you at the table.</Text>

            <Text>[3.1.2]The confusion, the slowed world, the pain - That must have been their aspects. Your heart is beating fast, fuelled by adrenaline, but not nearly that sickening rapid-fire speed it was just a few seconds ago. Stupid. What just came over you?

“OK.” You breathe out, calming yourself down. “OK. I’m listening.”

“Do you know why your sister defected?” Rasputin asks.

You seethe but manage to hold the anger in. “No.” Your heart is still pounding faster than it ought to be and you resist the instinct to struggle against the remaining hands on you.

“She asked us why we were fighting. She asked us what our cause was. And when she found out, she asked how she could help. The answer to that was simple in her case. She has the most intriguing Aspect, you see, as I assume you know quite well. That, my dear [Name], is why Eve defected.”

You’re quiet for a second. Eve has always been more curious than is healthy, always pulling you into trouble, going where she shouldn’t go. But she is also smart. Smarter than you if you’re being honest (Which you may as well be seeing as it’s your own head). 

You have always trusted her before to have good reason for doing what she does even if you don’t agree.

“What was your answer?” you finally ask. 

Rasputin smiles, “Good question. But I think it best if I show you.”


[C2.1]”OK.” You say. The hands release you. You follow when Rasputin starts walking.

[C3.1.2.2]”Fuck that. I’m not going anywhere with you.” You say.</Text>

            <Text>[1.1.1.1]It doesn’t take long for you to leave the protective walls of the city. As you approach the edge more and more buildings sit dark, crumbling, and empty. The buildings loom, deep shadows stretching out from them where they aren’t during the day. 

You never come out here at night, and shouldn’t be out here now. But you have no time to second guess yourself as you hurry towards The Factory. 

You are hyper aware when you pass the place of the confrontation with the Vagabonds and as you go you peer into every dark alley, trying to see signs of where they went and where  they came from. 

You don’t catch sight of Eve nor anyone else. 

Your steps slow as The Factory looms up ahead, unnaturally quiet in the night. 


[C1.1.1.3]You slump, exhausted. You should head back home. There is always the possibility that Eve will just come back if you wait long enough.

[C1.1.1.1.2]You can’t give up now. You pick a random direction and head further into the Fringes, towards paths you’ve never taken.

[C1.1.1.1.3]You shiver looking at The Factory. It is the only thing keeping your city from the Bioforms and to have it powered down like this leaves you with a feeling of dread.</Text>

You delve deeper into the unknown and out into the fringes until the lights of the city fade behind you. You are left with the drab semi-darkness of night under the smog. 

A pale glow seeps in from all directions - a sign of the forest of unmoving Bioforms that surround the city. 

You wind through the streets, picking directions at the whims of your gut.

You hear something moving further up in the distance. Eve. You switch directions and start heading towards her as fast as your tired legs can carry you. Another noise and the shifting of a shadow. The sound of deep laughter. 

You slow back down to a walk. Past the beat of your own heartbeat you hear it again - laughter. Too deep to be Eve. 


[C1.1.1.2.1]Run.

[C1.1.1.2.2]Your heart is in your throat. You freeze in place.

[C1.1.1.2.3]You keep heading towards the sound of laughter, moving quieter than before. Maybe Eve is with them.

Then all so suddenly the pain is back and you gasp with it. Your heart flutters in your chest and it hurts. It’s all you can do to curl forward and try and endure it but in the process you feel it lurch and a sickening darkness takes over your vision.

            <Text>[1.1.1.3]It’s a quiet walk home. Your feet drag along the cracked pavement and by the time your house comes back into view you are wavering on your feet. 

You sleep roughly for far fewer hours than you need. The day starts like every other. Banging at your room's door and the sounds of shuffling feet. Drew hollers outside the door something indecipherable and then moves on. 

It’s the same wake-up call every morning.

You pull yourself out of bed where you managed to pass out last night. Eve’s bed still sits in the corner - stripped of its blankets. 

You eat your vaguely nutritious gloop like you do every morning while listening to the rest of the house as the workers all get ready for the early shift. Somewhere on the far side of the house Agnes’s baby, Sally is crying, as she is wont to do. 

It isn't long before Drew is making the rounds again, your ears prick up at the sound of his yelling. “We got ten minutes, Brian, if ye want grub before yur shif’ ye gotta get up and eat it!” a pause, “Ye’ll be bloody sorry when yur half staved slaving away at the tiller.” It’s honestly a life-send that you have Drew in your house. He makes sure all the workers get up every day and checks in on you all as he does. He’s invaluable.

Doors start opening throughout the house, other workers making their way out of the house and towards The Factory. That’s your queue.

The smog heavier in the air, more so than usual. The air is unnaturally still.

You walk with other workers but feel too tired to join in with their banter, your sisters' absence sits heavy on your shoulders.

It sucks. Why did she have to abandon you like that? You’ve been together since your parents died years ago. She was a constant presence in your life and sure she has always been a little flighty but fuck. Why did she have to up and become a fucking Vagabond sympathiser?

Liaba glances back at you, “Where’s your sister? Is she skipping out again.” She asks, falling back from the group to walk with you.

You grumble something even you know isn’t words and plod on, head down.

“Come on, [NAME]. Talk to me.” She bumps into your side. “Did you two fight? I heard something last night waaay after your fucking bedtime.”

“I don’t want to talk about it.” You don’t want to have to lie to her but your sister left you for the fucking Vagabonds last night and you are trying not to stay pissed about it. 

“Hmmmmm. Alright. But you are moping way more than usual. If your sister’s gotten into some shit again talk to me. Her stressing you out stresses me out and I’m not about that life.”


[C1.1.1.1.1.1]You give her a friendly punch on the shoulder. You feel better knowing she’s there for you.

[C1.1.1.1.1.2]Dread and guilt washes over you. You should tell her. She’s as much Eve’s friend as yours. She needs to know what Eve has done.

[C1.1.1.1.1.3][I1]You pull Eve’s ring out of your pocket. “Eve is gone.” Liaba looks at you quizzically.

            <Text>[1.1.1.1.2]The night draws on as you stumble through unfamiliar streets. The pale green glow reflecting off of the smog enough to light your wavering path. The light is a sign of the Bioforms that surround this vast city. They glow. 

You can’t bring yourself to run, exhausted as you are from your long day in the Factory, but you’re stubborn and refuse to turn back. 

The street sways under your feet. You are dizzy from lack of sleep and the stress of searching for your sister. 

What if you don’t find her?


[C1.1.1.1.2.1]Be overcome with emotions. The stress has taken its toll on you. You will never get your sister back.

[C1.1.1.1.2.1.2]You are lost. Try and find you way back home.

Where is she?

You gasp and your eyes prick. You’ve slowed almost to a stop.

Where the fuck is she?

You can’t stop, you can’t. You have to find Eve. You can’t loose her. She is all you have left. If she leaves you too you’ll have nothing. You have to get to her. Eve is out here. 

You cling to her ring, a gift from you to fer. She’s worn it since you both were kids even as her other jewellery changed. Why would she give it back?

How could she do this to you?

The only thing keeping you upright and moving at this point is your desperate anger - your bitter determination not to lose her too.

You stumble over a crack in the sidewalk and almost fall. You gasp in a breath, blinking as your eyes blur over. The unfamiliar buildings tower over you. 

You are completely and utterly lost and it’s all her fault. How could she?

Fuck her. And fuck you for letting her fuck you over like this.

Your eyes are blurring too much so see the street in front of you. You blindly stumble on. It’s no surprise when you trip.

You hit the ground hard, on hands and knees, and feel the palms of your hands tear. Eve’s Ring goes flying out into the street.


[I1]You have lost SISTERS RING


[C1.1.1.1.2.1.1]The soft ping of Eve’s ring hitting the street somewhere out in the dark shocks the anger out of you. Your emotions clog in your throat.

[C1.1.1.1.2.1.2]Fuck this. And fuck Eve’s ring. You haul yourself back to your feet, turn, and start walking in the direction you hope leads home.

            <Text>[1.1.1.1.3.1.1]You come to an open room. Huge cylindrical towers rise up out of the stone floor and through the ceiling above. This is where you stock the furnaces. 

Without the usual bustle of activity on the furnace floor, a feeling of dread permeates throughout. The furnaces have cooled considerably since the end of your shift. Even so, you know they will still be lit by morning when the next shift comes in to stock them back up to full blaze. The Factory hasn’t been turned off fully in recent memory. 

You wander between the chimneys, something you don’t often get a chance to do.

No one sane comes out here at night, and for good reason. The Vagabonds live in the Fringes and it isn’t safe to be out here alone. The Factory is just far enough away from the workers part of the city that if you screamed no one would hear you, despite the dead silence surrounding you.

You strain your hearing. Should you go back home? Or explore The Factory as it sits dark and empty?

You hear the faint murmur of voices coming from the direction of home. Fuck. Vagabonds. 


[C1.1.1.1.3.1]Go inside The Factory until you think it’s safe.

Crates are piled around a half dozen forklifts and along the back wall you see four old trucks lined up in front of huge shutter doors. The room glows green from the light coming in from outside.

What is this place? A few crates are propped open near you and you look inside. Dark metal contraptions line the crates. They look like machines - handheld tools - though you have no idea what they do just from looking at them. 

They have large cylindrical red chambers over what looks like a hand grip. You pick it up, surprised by how little is weighs for its size. It must be mostly hollow inside.

It sits neatly in your hand and your finger settles automatically on a small leaver under the red chamber.


[C1.1.1.1.3.1.2.1]Take the gun.

            <Text>[2.1]Eve sticks by your side and doesn’t say a word as the Vagabonds lead you away from your normal route home and deeper into the abandoned parts of the city. 

You wonder if this is how they recruited her, maybe this is how they recruit all their members. Just picking them up from the sidewalk and convincing them to go with them.

“Where are you taking me?” you ask after a few minutes of walking. You are heading straight for unknown roads. This is already further into the Fringes then you’ve walked before.

“Taking you?” Rasputin replies, “No, no. You can go back at any time. This is just a demonstration. I thought it best I show you what exactly we rebel against.”

You pass under a huge bridge. It is crumbling and cracked in a way that makes you doubt it’s going to stay standing for much longer. Some of the other Vagabonds stop there, leaving you to continue forward after Rasputin and your sister.

The other Vagabonds look nervous, eyeing up the crumbling buildings around you. What are they afraid of? Sure the bridge looks sketchy as fuck but its not much worse than the rest of the city.

You hesitate for only a second before jogging to catch up with Eve and Rasputin.

Rasputin starts talking again, “Have you ever wondered how the rations never run out? How you get new clothes when your old ones wear through with holes? Who makes those cans of food, who makes the clothes if all of us do? You all work in the Factory. Everyone works in the Factory.”

The buildings on the other side of the bridge are in an even worse state, half slumped into each other, with no signs that humans have lived here in a long time. At least the streets look walked, paths winding through the dust and rubble. 

Why did the other Vagabonds stay back? Why are they weary of this place? It’s the same as the rest of this crumbling city. 

Then, as you walk further out, you spot it, growing in the cracks of a building - A Bioform.

You take a half step back. The Bioforms are everything your community has ever feared. They are why you work so hard - you pump out smog to keep the Bioforms out of your sanctuary, Fragos, your city. For Bioforms to be growing here you must have come right out to the edge of the smogs killing reach. 

The tiny patches of flora you notice as you pass won’t produce enough pollen to kill anyone in these low numbers, and you and your sister have nothing to fear yourselves, but this must be why the other Vagabonds hung back. Bioforms are terrifying for a person who isn’t immune. Their presence means death.

“I don’t get it. What does the edge have to do with the rations?” you ask. 

Rasputin doesn’t turn back towards you to reply, and you sister just smirks, a knowing glint in her eye.

Patches of green grow on almost all of the buildings now and the air is starting to clear up from the smog heavy air you are used to. You breathe in deep and smell pollen. It’s something you haven’t smelled in a long time.

You wonder if Rasputin has an Aspect similar to yours and your sisters? Your Aspects make you immune to the toxins. It protects you from the Bioforms’ poison. Most people would die if they breathed in the sickly sweet scent for too long. 

“Is your Aspect like ours?” you ask. You fall into step next to Rasputin and Eve. Eve scoffs as Rasputin shakes his head. 

“My Aspect lets me sense importance. That is how I found this place - it had a huge swell of importance hanging over it.” He gestures as you come up to an empty crumbling lot, “And that is how I found Eve.” 

This is the first wide open space you have seen in a while. There are Bioforms growing all over the place, poking through the cracks and along rusted wire fences, a smear of green, vivid as poison against the grey tones of the city.

It’s not quite a forest but it’s more than most people have seen.

“I have no idea what ‘importance’ means. How is this place important?”

“It’s hard to describe how my Aspect works. At this location, I sense a swelling of significance that ebbs and flows through time. Right now it is almost at it’s crescendo. Something important is about to happen here. Watch.” He points far off over the tops of the buildings where the smog has thinned to almost non-existent levels. 

You squint in that direction. The sky is brighter than you are used to without the dampening cover of smog. For a few long seconds you see nothing, but then a glint catches your eye. There is something… in the sky?

Something pale and white. A flytecraft.

How… It’s been years since there were flytecrafts, since before you were born. Flytecrafts are flying transport ships that were common before the days of the pandemic. You’ve seen pictures from the history books and when you were a child you used to play in the hollow of a stripped out flytecraft but for one to be up and functioning.

“Fucking hell. A flytecraft.” You say.

“Right?!” Eve says, grinning at you. “It’s in like, mint condition and everything.”

The flytecraft is closer now and getting closer still. Fuck. How is it still running. You don’t even have cars anymore as all your resources go to producing smog in the factory. “Is there another city out there that still has flightcrafts running?” You ask, thinking out loud.

“We don’t know.” You look away from the flytecrafts decent to give Rasputin a sharp confused look.

“How don’t you know. Haven’t you asked? I’m not confused am I? This isn’t the first time the flytecraft has come here. From what you were insinuating I assumed this flytecraft is what’s been supplying the food and shit.”

“Yes that part is correct.” The flytecraft touches down with barley a whisper and doors open on several sides. “But we can’t exactly ask the pilots.”

Several delivery drones - robots from before the pandemic - exit from the multiple doors pulling trolleys and head off to the a gap in the fences you didn’t notice before.

“Where are they going?” you ask Rasputin. 

“To a drop off point close to the city. We have followed them multiple times before, we’ve blocked them, taken their packages, kidnapped them so we can pull them apart, we’ve even destroyed them. None of it helped us find out who they answer to. They have a singular purpose, to drop off their assets and get back to the flytecraft. That is all they know.”

The stream of delivery drones finally tapers off and dissapears between two buildings.


[C2.1.1]”I want to see for myself.” You say. Rasputin nods and gestures towards where the robots disappeared as if to say ‘After you.’

[C2.1.2]”If the robots were a dead end what about just getting on the ship and seeing where it goes?” Rasputin nods. “We did try that, yes.”

            <Text>[2.2]Eve speaks up, “It’s not the only way you shitty little [XTHER]. Do you have any idea what we’re doing?”

“No. And I don’t want to know. If you could all just give up this little charade and come back, it would-” you let out a frustrated sound. “The other workers would have it so much better. There would be less pressure on the individual. I could work a fucking six hour shift instead of a fucking twelve!”

“That doesn’t matter-” Eve starts. 

Rasputin motions for her to stop and you startle out of your tirade. You forgot to be scared of them for a second there. But Eve does that to you sometimes, frustrates you enough to start yelling.

“It does matter.” Rasputin says. “I know the workers are tired. But it had to be done. But don’t worry. All the pieces are almost in place. Relief is coming.”

“Well that wasn’t cryptic or anything.” You say before you can think better of it.

Rasputin chuckles. “I can’t give the game away. With your disposition you would go running to whatever authorities you think could do something to stop as and foil our plans. What’s more important then what we’re doing, is why.”


[C2.1]”Why then.” You ask. He motions for you to follow. You follow.

[C2.2.1]”Why then.” You ask. He motions for you to follow. You don’t trust him in any way. “What? I’m not going with you.”

[C2.2.2]Whatever they’re planning maybe you can stop it right here and now. You thumb the flick knife in your pocket.

            <Text>[2.1.1]”Go get the others.” Rasputin says to Eve. She nods and peels off from your party. You hesitate, not wanting to be alone with Rasputin. He arches an eyebrow at the look you are giving him then head off after the Robots himself.

You follow.

The first thing the Robots do is head underground. They dip down into the gloom of an old subway system and disappear out of sight. “They don’t surface again until they return to the ship.” Rasputin says. 

“I still want to see for myself.” He nods at your words.

“Your sister was the same way - lacking trust. It’s admirable. I know you are committed to doing the right thing.”

“Yeah I’m still not sure on that. Like the Flytecraft is cool and all but why exactly is it important? The Factory still needs to run if we want to keep out people alive.”

“Ah, I should have explained further. What is important about the Flytecraft isn’t that it still exists. It is that if it exists, that means that there are people on the other side who survived the pandemic. Not only that, wherever they are, they are thriving. Now I only want what’s best for this city and I believe that if we can transport everyone from here to wherever there is, everyone will be better off.”

Suddenly the connection is clear to you. He is desperately trying to find out where the food is coming from, because wherever there is, you will thrive. You get it. Why just survive when you could all live in prosperity?

The Flytecraft is the connection.

The other Vagabonds meet up with you at the entrance and you all head down, several of them pulling out flashlights to light the way. The Robots have mad their way onto the tracks and are heading in the direction of Town.

It’s a slow walk.  

You did your fair share of exploring back in your youth with Eve, before you both had to start work in the Factory. You even went all the way to the edge. That was where you discovered your Aspect. Both you and Eve were immune to toxins. Though there is a slight difference. Your Aspect manifests itself as a sort of invisible shield, a barrier that protects anyone inside whereas Eve herself is immune to the toxins and though she has breathed in the Bioforms poison she has never gotten sick.

People still go to the edge of the city even though they know of the dangers of the Bioforms poison. You know because kids still come home teary-eyed and sneezing and are rushed inside by their mothers to get the yellow dust cleaned out of their clothes. 

Most of them don’t die.

Most of them stay in bed for a few days and shake until the small amount of poisonous pollen clears through their system.

You and your sister though had gone deep into the trees and never caught their sickness. 

Your friends had stuck by your side and been safe too. Your shield had grown as you aged and as long as they stayed close, they stayed healthy.

Your party of Vagabonds come to a halt as the Robots stop ahead of you. You watch as they lower their packages, lining them up in a neat pile.

There are no obvious landmarks you can see in the darkness. You’ve passed several side passages and the tracks have widened and shrunk as paths have converged. If your estimations are correct you have been heading towards town and should now be close to its center if you haven't passed under it entirely.

“The Robots will head back the way they came if you want to confirm that too.” Eve says, looking bored. 


[C2.1.1.1]You want to get back to the Flytecraft. “Maybe I do. Maybe I want to see where they go after they get back.” You say to Eve.

[C2.1.1.2]”Who comes down to collect the packages?” You ask Rasputin, ignoring your sister’s remark. 

[C2.1.1.3]”I think I’ve seen enough of these Robots. I believe you.” You say to Rasputin. He nods, looking satisfied.</Text>

A week after Juniper disappeared we sent a rescue party of 6 Vagabonds to try and retrieve her but they were met with the same fate, whatever that may be.” Rasputin frowns, looking up at the flytecraft sitting idle in front of you. “I would have sent more, but I don’t want to loose more of my people.”

Eve looks uncharacteristically somber, her eyes wide behind her large round glasses. “I didn’t know. I mean I knew something had happened to your previous second but I didn’t know that she had been… lost. Like that.”

“Yes well, as great as Maxim is, he is no Juniper.”


[C2.1.2.1]”I’ll go after her.” You say. Rasputin glances your way, surprised. “I’ll find out where she went and bring her back.”

[C2.1.2.2]”Who’s Maxim?” you ask. Rasputin gestures again and starts walking. “Let’s walk while we talk. I think you are ready to see where we base ourselves.”

It’s too dark to see. But the blurry human shapes look too large to be your sister. You shove your way out of your blanket but more hands and a knee hold your limbs down. Their weight hurts.

 More shapes come into view. There must be at least three of them now surrounding your bed. 

You try and push the cloth out of your mouth but then another of the assailers is grabbing you roughly by the head and tying more cloth around your mouth, keeping the gag in place. 

You tense and try to throw off the people holding you down, your yelling muffled through your gag.

He uncovers your mouth only for the second figure to shove a balled up piece of cloth into your mouth a second later. You let them, and shake. What the fuck? What is even happening? Are you being kidnapped or something?

“[Xe]’s being awfully quite don’t you think, Greg?” the second figure says. The first one grunts and holds you still by the shoulders even as you don’t struggle against him. “I was expecting a real fight with this one but I guess you can never really tell.” 

“I wish you would take [Xis] queue, Patrick.” A female voice says from over near the door. How many of these guys are there? It suddenly dawns on you that these must be Vagabonds and you feel yourself tense up with renewed fear. What the fuck do the Vagabonds want with you that they’ll go to all the trouble of kidnapping you over it?

“Shhhhhhh!” a female voice says from closer to the door, sounding angry. “Keep it down. We don’t want to be caught.” 

Yes you fucking do. You shout out a strangled “Help!” before the same large hands are closing over your mouth. 

“Stop.” The man holding your mouth closed says. You strain and scratch at his hands. You hear and loud thud coming from the room next to yours and a voice muffled through the walls. 

“Shit, boss. Abort?” the second male says, backing away from you.

“Agreed. There are more people waking up.” The woman says. “Let’s get out of here before the whole building comes down on us.” 

The first and largest assailant immediately lets go of you and sprints out the door, his footfalls surprisingly light for his large frame. The second man falls back almost as quickly, stumbling over himself on the way out the door and then all three of them are gone, leaving the door clicked shut behind them.

“Not you, Greg. Patrick!” She shout whispers. “Where’s the rucksack!” 

“Greg’s got it, boss.” The man tying you up says. He pulls the cloth tight around your mouth and you flinch as it digs into your skin.

“We’ll, get it from him and put it on the kid. We have to move.”

“I’m not sure [Xe]’s a kid, boss. [Xe]’s been working in the factory I hear. Must be at least my age.” Gag-man Patrick says as he rustles around in the pockets of strong-man Greg. You try and head-butt him but the angle isn’t right and end up just lightly knocking your head against his arm.

“Semantics, Patrick. You’re all kids to me. Just hurry up. We have to be out of here ASAP if we want to not wake the whole bloody building.” Patrick seems to find what he was looking for because be pulls out from Greg’s endless pockets and shoves a heavy cloth bag over your head.

“Right you are, boss.” He says. You gag as he pulls it tight around your neck. Your arms are tied up next, tightly bound behind your back with thick rope. Then your legs are tied as well.

Greg finally shifts off you and you gasp out a deep breath, panting through your nose into the inside of the sack. 

“Right. We ready boys?” says the boss.

“All tied up and ready to go, Boss.” Patrick replies, slightly too loudly. He is shushed promptly by the Boss lady but you can only hope someone heard him anyway.

In a rush you are picked up and hauled over someone’s shoulder - Greg from the size of them. You have been throughly acquainted by his bulk at this point.

            <Text>[1.1.2.1.2]You punch the closest one right in the balls. He lets out a squeak and topples over sideways away from you. You feel a wash of bitter satisfaction from bringing your attachers down a peg.

“Greg! No!” The person at your head yells. He stops where he was tying the gag in place over your mouth and you take the opportunity to head-butt him as hard as you can with the back of your skull. 

His face makes a disgusting crunching noise on contact but you have no time to think about that. The third attacker comes towards you with three quick strides from where they were standing guard at the door.

“Fucking hell Patrick.” She says in a harsh whisper, “Keep it down. We don’t want this whole building down on us.” They might not but you fucking do. You want to scream for help and bring the whole building down upon them. Fuck. The gag is still in place. You can only hope someone decides to come and see what Patrick’s screaming was about before these people do whatever the fuck they are trying to do to you.

You scramble away from all of them, trying to get past and get to the door. If you can get out and get to someone else’s room-. Patrick, dripping blood from his nose, makes to grab you around the waist, arms and all. You slip one arm free and bonk him on the head a few times with your fist, trying to distract him from pinning down your other limbs.

The only thing between you and safety is a gag and four sets of hands. Your eyes dart to the door, trying to size up your escape route.

The woman sighs and lightly thumps her boot against strong-man Greg where he is still clutching himself and slumped over. “At least he’s quiet about it.”

Patrick clings tighter to you, attempting to pin down your other arm and you struggle, kicking out desperately. You manage to hit Greg again and he grunts but Patrick just clings tighter. “Blimey fucking christ. Stay still!” Patrick hisses at you.

“Can you not subdue one half-starved worker, Patrick?” the boss says.

“[XE]’s a wiley one, boss.” Patrick replies. You manage to elbow him in the stomach with the last of your draining strength. Somehow he still hasn’t managed to pin your free arm down even as your struggling grows weaker with your growing exhaustion. “A little help would be appreciated?” He wheezes. 

You barley see her move before she grabs your flailing wrist in her strong grip. You tug but she doesn’t budge, she just pulls your other arm out of Patrick’s hold and pulls you to your feet, crushing your back against her front. “Get the rucksack on [XER].” She says to Patrick who has found himself suddenly bereft of a job.

You struggle against her grip but she just holds you tighter, digging her fingers into the skin of your arms. No. You can’t let her win. You heave in a breath through your nose and redouble your attempt to get free. 

“Right you are, boss. I’ll just get it from Greg.” The boss grunts on affirmation from behind you, easily keeping up with your struggles to escape. Even when you stomp your full weight onto her foot she doesn’t budge. 

You are surprised when Greg manages to uncurl from his protective ball and pull a dirty black bag out from his pocket. “Here.” He hands it to Patrick who stumbles back over to where you are still struggling against the boss lady and promptly pulls it over your head. 

It immediately cuts out the weak light that had been filtering into the room. The sack pulled tight around your neck and you choke. “Got ‘[Xm].” Patrick’s voice says muffled through the cloth. “Fucking balls [Xe] was a tough one. Looking at [Xer] I wouldn’t think [Xe] had it in ‘[Xm].” You wheeze out a harsh breath, exhausted even as you continue to struggle.

Your hands are pulled tight behind your back and secured tightly with a piece of rope before you can even try to slip free. Then suddenly you are falling forward and hit the mattress with an ‘oof’. More rope is tied around your ankles. Fuck.

Someone hauls you onto their shoulders - Greg from the size of him - and starts walking.

“You ‘ight Greg. [Xe] gave you a real walloping back there.” Says Patrick.

“I’ll live.” Greg grunts.

            <Text>[1.1.2.1.1.1]The group of you walk for a long while. No one stops you. For a while you squirm and kick against Greg but it drains you faster than you would like. For the longest part of the walk you hang limp where you are slumped over Greg’s shoulder, trying not to wince at he digs bruises into your leg and breathing pitifully through each painful thump of his footsteps. 

Patrick starts chattering again once you assume the four of you have made it out past the main cluster of occupied houses. They must be taking you into the Fringes. It’s the only other place to go around here that isn’t The Factory.

Either that or they plan to dump you out in the shrub-lands where the Bioforms start to grow around the city’s edge. 

You don’t know why they would do that though. That would be fucked up. And they would get exposed too.

Not that you have anything to fear from the shrub-lands yourself. You’re immune. 

“How are you holding up Greg? Do you need to take a break? I would offer to carry [Xer] myself but [Xe] probably weighs more than me.” Patrick barks out a laugh.

“I’m fine.” Greg replies. 

You yourself are not fine. Greg’s stomach is digging into your stomach and it hurts like a bitch. You can feel the bruise worsening with every heavy step he takes.

“Ye’know that’s what I like about ’chu, Greg. You have stamina. Can really take a few punches and come right back at ‘em.”

“’Preciate the kind words, Patrick.”

“Well you can’t blame me for pointing out the truth. I wish my aspect was as strong as that. Mine just keep me awake! Which, you know, I don’t really mind as such. It’s real handy for the long shifts when we need important jobs like this done. 

“It’s probably for the best I don’t have your aspect. Honestly, I don’t think I could handle so much strength. I’m way too clumsy. You wield it with such class, Greg.” Greg hefts you up higher on his shoulder and you wheeze out a painful breath.

Either of those aspects sounds great to you - strength or whatever weird insomnia aspect Patrick has. All you have is fucking ‘immune to toxins’. Which, sure, protects you from the Bioform poison but The Factory protects you anyway! Within the walls of the city no one is even exposed to the poisonous gas that covers the rest of the globe so your whole immunity thing helps with shit-all.

“Where are we keeping [Xer] anyway?” Patrick asks. You perk up. They’re keeping you? Why the fuck do they want you? Maybe your sister requested you or something and thought this was the only way to recruit you. 

To be fair to her you didn’t make it sound like you wanted to join her gang of rebels. On the other hand side fuck her. 

“The cells. We can’t exactly host [Xer] with the rest of us. We might get stabbed in the night. We didn’t exactly bring [Xer] in on the best of terms.”

            <Text>[1.1.2.1.1.1.1]You are dumped on the ground surprisingly gently by Greg. The sack is pulled off your head and you squint against the sudden light. You are in a dark windowless room with a heavy metal door guarding the only way in or out. It’s currently open but Greg positions his bulk in the doorway in its stead.

“Alright pipsqueak lets get these ropes off ‘a you.” Patrick says. He starts untying you, starting with the foul tasting gag in your mouth. 

As soon as the gag is out you speak. “What do you want with me.”

“Eh?” Patrick asks, working on untying your feet next. “Don’t look at me. I don’t fuckin’ know. What about you Greg? Do you know?” He asks behind him.

Greg shrugs and glances behind you. You look up to see the women they call ‘Boss’ standing behind you.

“Don’t worry about that right now. Rasputin will be down to check on you soon enough. If you’re lucky he will tell you then.”

“How can you tell be not to worry. You fucking kidnapped me. I’m here for some shady fucking reason-. Do you honestly think that after all this I’m going to help you guys with-. With whatever the fuck it is you want from me?”

“Listen I don’t ask questions.” Patrick says tugging you towards him by your hands. You were talking at the Boss but she looks like she’s happy for Patrick to take this one. “They just point me in a direction and I go. You might not trust us right now but you’re gonna understand one of these days that we are on the right side of this.”

“He’s right you know.” Greg says. “We’re gonna save everyone.”

“Are you almost done there Patrick.” The Boss says. “It’s late and I still need to report to Rasputin.”

Only your hands are still tied. Patrick keeps unwinding the rope around your hands. “Almost, boss. I’m on watch tonight right? You two get some rest. I’ll make sure this one stays put till tomorrow.” 

The Boss grunts and steps over you just as the last piece of rope falls from your hands. You think about attacking them as Patrick stands up with a creak and a groan and ducks under Gregs arm to get out the door but decide against it. 

Your limbs are stiff and sore from being carried and even getting up off the floor is going to be an effort. 

The door clicks shut behind Greg and through the window Patrick calls out. “I’ll be on the other side of this door and I don’t fucking sleep so don’t think about trying nothin’.” 

Great.

You glance around and notice a cot behind you. It’s got blankets on it even though you probably won’t need them. It’s a long way away from the cold season.

You manage to haul yourself to your feet and flop down into it.

You have no idea what will happen in the morning, ahead of you stretches a field of unfathomable unknown bullshit. 

Before you can spiral too far into thoughts of ‘why you’ you fall asleep. It has been a long day.

            <Text>[3.1]”Fuck you!” You yell. You don’t think you just act, the knife in your hand aimed for her. She’s a traitorous shit-head and she’s acting like she’s better than you for it.

You slash with a downward arc.

You can feel the seconds stretch into eternity as your heart pounds in your throat. Rage bubbling and spilling over with the arc of the knife.

Except, the blade never connects. Impossibly fast your sister dodges out of the way, stumbling back with shock written all over her face. Then, just as fast hands are detaining you, pulling the knife from your grip before you can react. Your heart is so loud in your head. You can’t think over the noise of it.

What’s happening? Why are they so fast. Your heart is beating double-time in your chest - aching as it beats rapid-fire. Several hands hold you back and in a blink the tall Vagabond - Rasputin - is in front of you. 

They are moving so fast you can’t think. Your head pounds. Rasputin is saying something, turned away from you, too fast for you to catch. 

Between one blink and the next you feel your mind pull itself back together from where it has sprawled out in a haze of confusion.

“Now then.” Rasputin says to you. 

“Fuck.” Eve interrupts, voice shaking. “I never thought [Xe] would… You pulled a knife on me.” Her face has gone white and her wide-eyed stare is back.

You breathe out heavily. “What was that? That felt… bad.” 

“I think I’ll be the one doing the talking here, [Name]. That was an idiotic stunt you pulled back there. If you look like you’re going to attack one of my people again I’ll let Borris and Jene put you under again. Consider your next action carefully now. By now you’ll know how unpleasant it could be for you.”

            <Text>[3.2]Almost immediately you feel the world go soft around you. The knife falls from your fingers and you feel your consciousness stretch apart and scatter. 

You stumble, your limbs disconnected.

You are awake but your thoughts are so far apart from each other that the world just exists around you with no effort on your part.

When your mind pulls itself back together you are being held up by multiple hands, your dropped knife gone.

“What?” you say.

“Now then.” Rasputin says to you. “What were you planning on doing with this.” He holds up the knife.

You gape at it, shocked at how fast the situation dissolved out of your control. “I…” you hesitate. What were you planning? Against this group of Vagabonds all with unknown Aspects you stood with your shitty toxicity immunity and a three inch blade. “I don’t know.” You finally say, lamely.

“Well, I’m glad we stopped you then.”

Eve interjects, “What the shit, [Name]!? What is with you today? I know what I’m doing. You don’t have to follow me and keep me in line like you’re always trying to do. This doesn’t concern you.”

“It does though.” You say, conscious of your bubbling emotions. Eve always knows how to rile you up. 

“What exactly is it that you think we’re doing?” Rasputin asks. He motions and the hands holding you back drop away. You realize the Vagabonds are surrounding you now, with you, Eve, and Rasputin in the center.

You are the only one who looks concerned with this arrangement.

“Well, you obviously don’t want to work so you’re abandoning the Factory and leaving the rest of us to shoulder the-”

“Wrong!” Eve interjects.

You fume, but don’t take a step forward.

Rasputin explains Eve’s rude comment further, “Despite her method of communication, Eve is correct. It is not that we don’t want to keep the city safe from the Bioforms, it is that we believe that there is a better way, an easier way, a way that would keep everyone safe while also freeing them from the toll the Factory takes on them.”

“How?” You say.

Rasputin motions for you to follow, “I think it best if I show you.”


[C2.1]Intrigued, you follow.

[C3.1.2.2]”I’m not going to go with you? Are you insane?” You take a step back.

            <Text>[1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1]Once you have decided to go with them you don’t try and fight them. They take through a fairly direct path to their base, almost taking no turns to get there.

“Yeah we just had to get out to the edge of the city,” Eve explains, “The edge of the city is in every direction. Why the fuck would I take a complicated path to get there. It’s lucky we found you actually. What are the chances?” She grins.

“Sure, yeah. Lucky.” You say rolling your eyes.

It doesn’t take long for you to approach the Vagabond’s hideout. You know you’re close when you see someone rush past your group without galsing back. An older guy with a scruffy beard you think you recognise but can’t quite place is leaning up against a wall. With a deep voice he says, “Evening, Eve.” As you walk past.

“That joke’s getting old, Tom.” Eve replies as Eve pulls you into a doorway of the nondescript building he’s leaning against. You are pulled down a short entryway and through another door at the end.

You are somewhat shocked to find the next room crawling with vagabonds. Your eyes dart around, trying to take in all the people milling about. People in nightcaps and stripy pyjamas sit around with hot drinks in their hands while others in the usual black Vagabond clothes move around and through more doorways.

Eve doesn’t let you linger though, pulling you through the throng of people and towards another door.

Some lanky dude steps in front of your group before Eve can get where she is hauling you though.

“How the shite did you fucking find ‘[Xm]. We were the one out looking for ‘[Xm]!” the random dude says, aghast for some reason. They were looking for you?

“Wait you were looking for my [Xther]? And I wasn’t told? Why the hell not?”

“Oi. Don’t yell at me. I was just doing a job. You know how it is in this business. The ones on top give you orders and you follow through. Where did you find ‘[Xm] anyway?” He says peering at you curiously.


[C1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1]You cut your sister off before she can reply again like you’re not in the fucking room.

Your head hurts and you lean against a building for a moment to catch your breath. You don’t know where you are but you know it’s far from home. You walked for so long just to get here, not thinking of how hard it would be to get back.

You pull yourself up and back to walking. It’s slow going but you can’t bring yourself to walk faster. Your legs tremble as it is. 

The light has changed since you’ve been out here, brightening. Is it near daybreak already?

Fuck. You sink down into a crouch, just for a second, you tell yourself. But you ache to just rest here. You can feel your whole body trembling with the fatigue of this adventure.

The solid concrete at your back feels like bliss compared to standing.

You’ll get up in a second, you tell yourself.

You can’t stay here. You have to get home, you tell yourself.

            <Text>[1.1.1.1.3.2.2]You head towards home, walking as quietly as you can. You can almost hear the voices if you stop and strain to listen to them. Every time you do you adjust your path home, taking detours that lead you further away from the group of voices.

Luckily, they seem to be heading deeper into the Fringes away from your route home. You let out a sign of relief and stop once more to listen for them. They are so far away now that you can no longer hear them, even with how dead silent the night is. 

A bone deep tiredness has settled over you now. What were you thinking? Why did you run out after your sister like that? Stupid. This city is too vast and too unknown. There was no way you could have found her. 

Chances are there is some secret Vagabond passageway out to their hide-out you never would have stumbled upon anyway. 

And now, because you decided to run out after Eve, you just know you’re going to be even more exhausted than normal during work tomorrow.

You see a shadow shifting out of your periphery before you’re tackled to the hard pavement by a large shape. 

The wind is knocked out of you. You wheeze out a breath, stunned. The shape - a large man - is pressing you down into the pavement with his weight. 

You can’t breathe.

Two more shapes come into your line of sight - more people. “Whoop!” one of them says - a man, “We got ‘[Xm], boss. What are the chances, eh?” Fuck. Are these guys fucking Vagabonds?

You finally pull in a painful breath to shout, “Get the fuck off me!” - hoping someone will hear you. But you know you are still too far away from home. No one but Vagabonds would dare be out this far this late at night. 

Apart from your stupid fucking ass.

“Get the gag, Patrick. We have no time to waste.” A woman’s voice says - the third Vagabond. 

You are so fucked. “No! Get off - mmmmmph!” While the first man still crushes you, muffling your yelling by virtue of the weight pressing on your lungs - the other man pulls out a foul smelling cloth and stuffs it in your open mouth. 

You thrash and try to push the cloth out but he ties another one around your mouth, keeping the first in place.

“Great work with that tackle, Greg. Truly astounding if I do say so myself.” The second man - Patrick - says, tying the gag off with a sharp tug that digs into your skin. You wince.

“All in a days work.” The man on top of you says. You thrash but his hold on you is too solid and your already tired body is worn out after running off into the night like you did.

“Which pocket is the rucksack in, Greg? I can never remember where you shove things in the big coat of yours.” Your mind is whirring, trying to think of a way to escape. One of your hands isn’t pinned under you and you claw at the gag.

“Bottom right.” Greg says, he pulls your hand away from your face by the wrist and when you manage to pull your other arm free from under you he grabs that too. Patrick riffles through Greg’s coat and pulls out a black bag which he promptly shove over your head and pulls tight. It’s musty and unpleasantly warm. 

“Well, this was easier then I expected.” The woman says. “And to think we thought we missed [Xer] too. What are the chances we would stumble upon [Xer] on the way back home after calling the mission a failure. Rasputin will be amused.”

Greg shifts his weight off of you, pulling you up by your wrists which he still has gripped tight in his fists. He has pulled you up so high your feet don’t touch the ground.

You are fully hog-tied and still have no idea what is going on. What do these Vagabonds want with you? Unless they’re in the habit of kidnapping every person they come across who’s stupid enough to wander around alone at night.

Fucking hell. 

Greg hauls you up and over his shoulder.

“Come on boys.” The woman says, “Let’s get back to HQ. This had been one surprisingly successful mission.”

“I must say, boss, I completely agree.” Patrick says, “I thought we had missed [Xer] for sure when [Xe] weren’t in [Xis] bed like we assumed [Xe] would be. What are the chances we would stumble across the fucker out here on our way back? It’s amazing it is.” So they were after you specifically. 

But how did they hear you? You were so quiet? You had thought you lost them when you had stopped hearing them talking but somehow they caught you anyway.

With every step Greg takes his shoulder digs further into your stomach, forming bruises. You wiggle, trying to alleviate the pressure on your stomach. 

“And you Greg!” Patrick continues, “What a catch. That was one spectacular tackle if I do say so myself. Now that’s what I admire about you, Greg. You really know how to handle your aspect.” 

You wished you had a good aspect. Something that was actually helpful. Greg get something that helps him tackle good apparently and all you get is immunity to toxins. It protects you against the Bioforms, sure, but the city does that already! It’s functionally useless. 

Greg’s painful walking continues.

After a beat, you walk forward again. 

This far out, you won’t find your sister. The Vagabonds wouldn’t dare come this close to the edge of the city least they succumb of the sickness of the Bioforms. 

But you and your sister are immune to toxins. That immunity is your Aspect. You yourself emit a sort of toxin neutralising force field. Anyone within it is protected as well. While your sister is immune to toxins themselves. 

It means neither of you will ever get sick from the Bioforms. 

Your Aspect does shit-all to help you in everyday life though. The reason you were assigned to the furnaces is that you keep yourself and everyone around you safe from any toxins generated from the burning material. But even if you don’t get sick, you are still exhausted every day. The work takes its toll on you.

If only you had a useful Aspect, like your friend Liaba’s bursts of energy after eating, or Reginald’s tough, heat-proof skin. That’s the sort of Aspect that helps with everyday life in The Factory.

Bioforms have started sprouting around the buildings, and the sky is clearing. You must be getting to the edge of where The Factory’s smog reaches. Up above you can see the first signs of stars through the growing glow of the Bioforms.

You hurt and you want to feel it.

You can feel the tear tracks falling down your cheeks and paw at your face with one clumsy hand smearing them. 

Your other hand holds the rock but no matter how hard you grip it, feeling it dig into your scraped up palm, the pain of losing your sister is greater.

It’s in the brief span of silence that you hear the footsteps coming up from behind you.

“[Name]?”

You turn, “Eve?” you ask.

“What are you doing out here?” Eve asks. You glance from her to the girl beside her. You can’t tell if she looks younger then you or not. She stares back, not saying anything.

“I - I lost your ring.” You say.

“My ring? What are you even talking about? I don’t care about that stupid ring. What! Are you doing!? Out Here!? Give me the why!”

Despite her forceful voice she looks more concerned for you than angry that you lost her ring. You breathe out, stealing yourself, “I was looking for you. I can’t let you do this. The Vagabonds are - are…” You glance at the girl beside her again. She awkwardly looks away.

“Fuck off. I’m fine. Just, Just go home [Name]. I don’t have time for this.” 

“I can’t. I can’t just let you leave like that. Also, I don’t know where I am.” 

Eve groans. “Why are you like this. Shit. OK. You’re coming with us then.” She pulls you out of the dirt by the arm and dusts you off. “What were you ding on the ground anyway? Wait. You know what. I don’t care. Just shut up and come with us.”

She stomps off in a direction you are sure is the opposite of where you want to go.


[C1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1]”No. I can’t. I have to go home.” You say, “Can you just point me in the right direction?”

You drift in and out of sleep as the sky brightens around where you are slumped against the side of a building. 

Between one blink and the next the smog has changed from a deep electric green - reflecting the glow of the Bioforms - to a dusty light blue as the light from the sun shines through the layers of smog and drowns out the green of the Bioforms’ glow.

Your legs ache. You aren’t sure exactly how many hours you wandered out here in the city but after your long day at work it was more than your body could take. 

Still, You don’t manage to pull yourself back to your feet until well after daybreak.

            <Text>[1.1.1.1.2.3.1]The Bioforms multiply startlingly quickly, you have only walked the length of a street and the Bioforms have already transformed from glowing green moss clinging to cracks, to vines winding up the sides of buildings, to bright trunks with buds like light bulbs, the streets turning from an urban sprawl to a deep forest within a few short strides.

The flat streets start to buckle in places as the concrete is warped where the Bioforms have burrowed underneath it. 

It’s been a long time since you’ve been this far out into the wilderness, even though you are still technically within the old walls of the of city Fragos.

You can see ahead of you the pale glowing dust-like particles of the pollen falling from the Bioforms. The tiny lights hit your Aspect and go out, their poisons neutralised. 

You have never seen the Bioforms growing this close before. Years ago, when you came to the edge of Fragos in the past, the glowing Bioform moss would stretch for streets before you saw even the first hint of vines starting to cling back to life. 

You run your hand over a tree trunk and watch as the glow fades from its bark. 

You are soon surrounded by trees. The concrete has fallen under the onslaught of mulch and dirt. The ground is soft and uneven with holes and mounds. Hidden Bioform roots try and trip you up - it is nothing like the city.

You look up and through the foliage see streaks of starlight shining through - the night sky is brighter than you have ever seen it. 

The ever pervasive smog wisps away and clumps together in the sky and you can see all the way up into the shape of the clouds and beyond.

It’s like a distant dream - memories spark from your childhood. You had forgotten the sky. But with a snap you remember being here before with your sister Eve and your friends. 

Above you is more points of light than you can count. 

To think that your ancestors came from on of those stars - that they might be there still. It has been a long long time since humans came to Dirth. Most of the knowledge of those ancient people have been lost.

“No I won’t,” you say reflexively

“Yes you fucking will, [Name], I know you. Now come on. I have things to do and if you’re coming along you may as well help me do them”


[C1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2]”What things?” You ask, following after her and the girl with her.

            <Text>[1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2]”This is a top secret Vagabond mission. It’s to do with my aspect. Apparently they’ve been looking for someone who can survive out where the Bioforms are for years now.” Eve is striding ahead almost faster than you can keep up. Neither you nor the other girl interjects. 

Eve continues, “Who would have thunk it, eh? We always thought our Aspects were so useless but it’s what they’ve been looking for the entire goddamn time!” Eve grins at you while the girl with her continues to stare at you, impassive. 

“So what,” You say, “They want to live out in the wilderness? Is that it?” 

“I don’t know. I haven’t asked. Being a Vagabond got me away from that shitty fucking Factory so if they want me to go out and test my Aspect with Ellie-May-” 

“Hi.” Ellie-May says, speaking for the first time.

“-then I fucking will.” Eve finishes.

“Eve won’t stop talking about you.” 

“What!” Eve says, “No, I don’t. Fuck you.” She shoves Ellie-May who just giggles and keeps walking just out of Eve’s reach. Cute.

“Anyway,” Eve says turning back to you, “Ellie-May here can mimic other people’s aspects-”

“Some people’s Aspects.” Ellie-May interjects.

“-some other people’s Aspects.” Eve continues, “So we’re going to see if she can become immune to toxins too.”

“You’re going to expose her to the toxins and see if doesn’t she die? Is that it?” You ask.

“No, stupid, She has a monitor on.” At this Ellie-May pulls out a small handheld device that you can see is wired into her arm. It’s what the doctor uses to check Bioform pollen levels in blood to determine if a patient is doomed or just caught a cold. 

“Huh.” You say. “Smart.”

“Come on. We’re near the edge.” 


It’s only a few minutes before you start seeing green. The glow reflecting off the smog clouds has grown steadily stronger as you get closer to the Bioforms. Soon specks of light start showing up, clinging to buildings and in cracks in the road. For anyone else this would be terrifying, your worst nightmare, but both you and Eve have been immune to toxins your whole lives and so have had no need to fear for your own lives out here.

You briefly wonder if your own Aspect will interfere with the data Eve and Ellie-May are trying to gather. Your immunity is like a barrier that spreads out from your body, neutralising any toxins that enter into it. 

You don’t think Eve has realised her mistake.

“This is stupid.” You say. Eve glares at you.

“And why, pray tell, is this stupid.”

“My Aspect dummy. Even if you didn’t have the Aspects you have, you would all be immune anyway.”

Eve purses her lips, looking at you, then squints. “How big is your radius again?” She asks.

“Dunno. Big.” You say. You would estimate it to be enough to cover the whole house you live in seeing as no one gets sick as long as you’re home. It’s at least big enough to cover the furnace floor at The Factory. No one has gotten black lung since you started working there and that used to be rampant.

“You’re useless. Go stand over there. We have testing to do.” She says.

“I don’t think that’ll be far enough. When I said big I meant fucking huge.”

“Urgh.” She groans. “Fucking hell. Why did you have to be out here. Ok. New plan. Me and Ellie-May are going to test if her Aspect can absorb mine from here - there should be enough pollen here where we’re standing to get a reading - and you are going to keep walking in that direction-” She points towards the edge where green glowing Bioforms start growing in thicker and thicker. “- until you’re out of range. Got it?”


[C1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1]”Got it.” You say, and start walking in the direction she pointed. It’s not like the Bioforms can hurt you anyway.

[C1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2]”Hey. How about fuck that idea. I’m going home.” You say, backing away.

            <Text>[1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2]Before either of them can stop you, you break into a sprint, hoping the girl with Eve doesn’t have an Aspect that can catch you.

Eve yells after you and you can hear the heavy footfalls of her chasing you down. “Get back here, [name], you piece of shit!”

It takes you a few more pounding gasping steps before you realise your mistake. You ran out of energy a long time ago. You can’t run.

By the time you’ve made it to the end of the street your breaths are wheezing out of you and you can hear the heavy footfalls of your sister steadily gaining on you. “Fuck off!” you yell back at her, hoping she’ll just let you go without a struggle.

Instead you are tackled from behind.

The breath is knocked out as you and face first on the pavement. Eve shifts so she’s sitting on top of you, pinning your hands to the ground. 

She has always been stronger then you. You wheeze into the ground.

“Fuck.” She doesn’t even seem out of breath. “That was stupid.” 

You just groan into the ground, still trying to get you breath back.

“What, did I break something, [Name]? You alright?” She leans further over you, pressing your chest further into the ground.

“Can’t breathe.” You manage.

She hums as if considering, “Nice try punk. If I let you up, are you going to run again? You know I can’t let you do that. You are too deep in this shit now. I’m gonna have to take you with me.”

“Are you kidnapping me?” you ask.

“I guess, now get up and stay close. I still have things to do. Ellie-May!” She shouts. 

“Yeah?” Ellie-May says from much closer then Eve must have assumed she was.

“Oh. You’re right there. Could you keep an eye on [Name]. Don’t let [Xer] run away. You know the Boss wont like that.

“Sure! I can do that. [Xe] doesn’t look like much anyway. Like, [Xe] couldn’t outrun you. Even I’m faster then you.”

“Shut up. I’m fast.”

“Nuh uh. You’ve been with the vagabonds for what, a week? It takes a while to build your stamina back up after working in the Factory for so long.”

“Wait you’ve been with the Vagabonds for a whole week?” you ask Eve. How did you not notice? Most days Eve walks with you and Liaba to The Factory for work though it’s just as likely that she’ll leave before you. Now that you think about it, you hadn’t seen Eve for most of the week, walked with her less then usual, and on more than one occasion you had slept without noticing her steady breathing in the same room as yours.

“I knew you were a zombie, [Name], but not to this extent. I’ve been gone this whole week!”

“Huh.” You guess you had been more tired then usual. More people had disappeared from The Factory this week and you had had to increase your work hours to keep up with demand.

Eve gets up off of you and you flip over. “Either way you’re coming with me.” She looks over as Ellie-May, “We may have to call off the whole testing our Aspects thing. Getting [Name] back to the bunker before [Xe] gets away sounds like a better idea, yeah?”

“Yeah.” Ellie-May says, drawing out the word into a disappointed sigh. “Next time though we’ll do it for sure!”

“Hey, wait a second. I’m not going with you.” You say. Eve looks at you, unimpressed.

“Uh, yeah you are.” She says, “It’s two verses one - less then one by my estimates. Don’t fight me on this.” 


[C1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1]You sigh and get up off the ground. There is no point fighting her on this.

[C1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.2]”Yeah there fucking is. I’m not going with you,” you say.

Huh. They step apart and the red haze recedes, settling back into Ellie-May’s shoulders. Maybe that means it worked?

Whatever. They aren’t going to be able to test it with you still this close. You keep walking.

The Bioforms multiply startlingly quickly, you have only walked the length of a street and the Bioforms have already transformed from glowing green moss clinging to cracks, to vines winding up the sides of buildings, to bright trunks with buds like light bulbs, the streets turning from an urban sprawl to a deep forest within a few short strides.

Further into the forest, you hear the sounds of a twig snapping.

Is there a person out there? What are they doing!? They could get killed.


[C1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1]You rush over to where you heard the sound. Your Aspect could save them if you can get to them in time.

Well, shit. Whoever is out there, they are coming towards you now, brushing through the dense foliage. You may have gone a little too far into the forest. “Is anyone else out there?” You ask whoever it is that’s coming towards you. “Friend or foe?” 

“Yeah, dummy. Ellie-May is here too. You just met her!” Eve answers from behind you. 

“Hola! I’m here too!” Ellie-May’s bubbly voice comes from the same direction Eve is. Whoever is coming towards you, it can’t be either of them.

Out of the brush steps a large glowing animal, bright fins flaring along its arched spine.

You have a second of wide-eyed fear, “Oh, shit.” You say before it pounces on you. 

Your barrier only stops toxins, not claws

“Up and at ‘em sunshine. They bought down breakfast before you have to face Rasputin, whatever it is he wants but hey! It shouldn’t be too bad. I remember when I was a new recruit and he greeted me then too!”

You sit up and blink at Patrick who pulls a panel down from the wall, turning it into a table shelf thing held up by chains and places on it a plate of what looks like surprisingly good quality re-hydrated food. 

You usually get your nutrients out of a can, leaving the better options for the people who need it more. It’s not like you don’t get enough to eat but this looks much more appetising then what you usually wolf down fast enough you don’t have to think about what it is you’re eating.

“Thanks.” You say. 

“All in a days work.” Patrick says, saluting you and heading back out the door. “Don’t take too long. I’m not sure when Rasputin wants to see you but you might want to be ready to go for a wander when he does.”

He closes the door behind him and leaves you to his food. You blink down at your plate, still half asleep. It must be nice, having an Aspect that leaves him so energetic all the time.

It’s no use. None of the buildings will have food in them - it’s been a long time since Fragos had people outside of the town centre. Even the Vagabonds slink around nearby rather than out here where you’ve found yourself.

By the time you’ve walked an hour your stomach has turned into a pit in your gut, you reach the edge of Fragos at one point where the Bioforms grow. Small patches of glowing moss cling to buildings. Above, streaks of sun can be seen through the smog as it thins this close to the edge of the city.

Pollen floats through the air, hitting the barrier that is your Aspect and dissipating into nothing. Your Aspect protects you from toxins and the Bioform pollen is no exception. 

You calculate that you must have been walking at an angle towards the edge for a while now and adjust your course. 

With your back to the Bioforms, you walk forward. At the centre of the smog cloud is The Factory and if you can find The Factory then you can find home.

But before you find home, you find the Vagabonds.

It rips through your clothes and skin, tearing both open. Through the haze of fear and pain you see blood dripping into the dirt near your face.

The Bioform bites you and pulls your skin open and you let out another weaker scream before you lose consciousness.
