\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, we just had to get out to the edge of the city,\u8221\'94 Eve explains, \u8220\'93The edge of the city is in every direction. Why the fuck would I take a complicated path to get there. It\u8217\'92s lucky we found you actually. What are the chances?\u8221\'94 She grins.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t take long for you to approach the Vagabond\u8217\'92s hideout. You know you\u8217\'92re close when you see someone else all in black. They rush past you. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A scruffy beard sporting older guy you think you recognise but can\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quite place is leaning up against a wall. With a deep voice, he says, \u8220\'93Evening, Eve.\u8221\'94 And grins as Eve as the three of you walk past. \u8220\'93Ellie-May.\u8221\'94 He nods at her behind you.}

You\u8217\'92re pulled down a short entryway and through another door at the end.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re somewhat shocked to find the next room crawling with Vagabonds. Your eyes dart around, trying to take in all the people milling about. People in nightcaps and stripy pyjamas sit around with hot drinks in their hands while others in the usual black Vagabond clothes move around and through more doorways.}
