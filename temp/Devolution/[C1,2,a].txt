[1.2.a]The factory protects everyone and the Vagabonds should know that. Eve should know that! The heavy smog it pumps into the air day in and day out forms a powerful chemical barrier against the Bioforms native to this planet. If it weren't for The Factory all of Fragos, your safe-haven in the forest, would have been slaughtered with the rest of the world in the Bioforms’ first attack.

And your sister is just thinking of her beauty sleep. Typical. 

She stops behind you where you are still slumped over the table. “You could join us.” She says, her tone cautious and hopeful.

“You could shut up.” You reply, voice muffled from where your face is pressed into your arm.

Sitting on the table is the ring you gave her her first day in The Factory.


[C1,1,1]You can’t let her do this. You slap yourself to back awake and pull yourself back to your feet. Then before you can second guess your sudden resolve you run out into the night to look for Eve.

[C1,1,3]Sleep drags your eyes back closed. You fall asleep at the table.
