[0002.1]"Fucking hell. A flytecraft." You say.

"Right?!" Eve says, grinning at you. "It's in like, mint condition and everything."

The flytecraft is closer now and getting closer still. Fuck. How is it still running. You don't even have cars anymore as all your resources go to producing smog in the factory. "Is there another city out there that still has flightcrafts running?" You ask, thinking out loud.

"We don't know." You look away from the flytecrafts decent to give Rasputin a sharp confused look.

"How don't you know. Haven't you asked? I'm not confused am I? This isn't the first time the flytecraft has come here. From what you were insinuating I assumed this flytecraft is what's been supplying the food and shit."

"Yes that part is correct." The flytecraft touches down with barley a whisper and doors open on several sides. "But we can't exactly ask the pilots."

Several delivery drones - robots from before the pandemic - exit from the multiple doors pulling trolleys and head off to the a gap in the fences you didn't notice before.

"Where are they going?" you ask Rasputin. 

"To a drop off point close to the city. We have followed them multiple times before, we've blocked them, taken their packages, kidnapped them so we can pull them apart, we've even destroyed them. None of it helped us find out who they answer to. They have a singular purpose, to drop off their assets and get back to the flytecraft. That is all they know."

The stream of delivery drones finally tapers off and dissapears between two buildings.

Choices:

[C2.1.1]1. "I want to see for myself." You say. Rasputin nods and gestures towards where the robots disappeared as if to say 'After you.'
[C2.1.2]2. "If the robots were a dead end what about just getting on the ship and seeing where it goes?" Rasputin nods. "We did try that, yes."
[C1.3]3. To be continued
