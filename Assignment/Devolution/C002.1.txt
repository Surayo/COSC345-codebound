[002.1]"Is your Aspect like ours?" you ask. You fall into step next to Rasputin and Eve. Eve scoffs as Rasputin shakes his head. 

"My Aspect lets me sense importance. That is how I found this place." He gestures as you come up to an empty crumbling lot, "And that is how I found Eve." 

This is the first wide open space you have seen in a while. There are Bioforms growing all over the place, poking through the cracks and along rusted wire fences, a smear of green, vivid as poison against the gray tones of the city. 

It's not quite a forest but it's more then most people have seen.

"I have no idea what 'importance' means. How is this place important?"

"It's hard to describe how my Aspect works. At this location, I sense a swelling of significance that ebbs and flow through time. Right now it is almost at it's crescendo. Something important is about to happen here. Watch." He points far off over the tops of the buildings where the smog has thinned to almost nonexistent levels. 

You squint in that direction. The sky is brighter then you are used to without the dampening cover of smog. For a few long seconds you see nothing, but then a glint catches you eye. There is something in the sky?

Something pale and white. A flytecraft.

How? It's been years since there were flytecrafts, since before you were born. Flytecrafts are flying transport ships that were common before the days of the pandemic. You've seen pictures from the history books and when you were a child you used to play in the hollow of a stripped out flytecraft but for one to be up and functioning.
