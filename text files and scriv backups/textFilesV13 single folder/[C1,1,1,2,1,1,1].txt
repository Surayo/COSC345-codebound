[1,1,1,2,1,1,1]You flail your legs wide, catching the guy in front of you in the stomach.

He lets out an, “Oof,” of breath and stumbles back, tripping over his own feet and landing heavily on his ass.

“Hey!” the Greg holding you up by the arms says. He shakes you. “Calm down.”

The third Vagabond is in front of you in a second, standing between you and the one on the ground. “That was a bad decision you just made there.”

The vagabond on the ground opens his mouth but just lets out a wheeze of air.

What. Like you’re supposed to feel sorry for these people? They’re kidnapping you!

“I’m alright, Boss.” The one on the ground says. The Boss doesn’t turn around, just pulls out her own rope and grips you by the ankle - hard. You wince as her fingers dig in.

She makes quick work of tying up your legs. You are dropped to the ground rather roughly and then a bag is being shoved over your head and tied around your neck. You choke for a second before the tie is loosened enough for you to breathe and tied off.

“Right then, boys. Let’s get going. We have to take this one back to base before [Xe] can make any more of a nuisance of [Xself].” The Boss says. Someone picks you up - Greg by the feel of them - and hauls you over their shoulder.

“Right you are, Boss.” A grunt. “Thanks for the hand.”

“Anytime, Patrick.” She says. Greg shifts you on his shoulder and starts walking.
