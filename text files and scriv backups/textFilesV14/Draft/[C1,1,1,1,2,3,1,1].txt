[C1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1]You hardly hear a rustle of leaves. It knocks you to the ground hard and pins you there - face down in the dirt. Before you can even think to move sharp hot agony pierces through your shoulder and you yell out from the white-hot pain.

It rips through your clothes and skin, tearing both open. Through the haze of fear and pain, you see blood dripping into the dirt near your face.

The Bioform bites you and pulls your skin open and you let out another weaker scream before you lose consciousness.
