[1,1,1,1,2]The night draws on as you stumble through unfamiliar streets. The pale green glow reflecting off of the smog enough to light your wavering path. The light is a sign of the Bioforms that surround this vast city. They glow. 

You can’t bring yourself to run, exhausted as you are from your long day in the Factory, but you’re stubborn and refuse to turn back. 

The street sways under your feet. You are dizzy from lack of sleep and the stress of searching for your sister. 

What if you don’t find her?


[C1,1,1,1,2,1]Be overcome with emotions. The stress has taken its toll on you. You will never get your sister back.

[C1,1,1,1,2,1,2]You are lost. Try and find you way back home.

[C1,1,1,1,2,3]Keep going. You can’t give up yet. You can still find her.
