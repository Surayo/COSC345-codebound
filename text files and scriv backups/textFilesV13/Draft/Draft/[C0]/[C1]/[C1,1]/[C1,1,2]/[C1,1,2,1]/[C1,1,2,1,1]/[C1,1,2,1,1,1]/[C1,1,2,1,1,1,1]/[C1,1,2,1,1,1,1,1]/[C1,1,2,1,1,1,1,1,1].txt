[1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1]”Right. This is everyone then.” He turns his back to you, surveying his group. 

Eve is with him. When you catch her eye you don’t see any sign or regret.

“Oh. Could you tie [name] up again Patrick. We need to be going in a few minutes.” You stand ready to fight your way past. 
(What are you doing. That’s sex fucking beefy people. Just because you had a nights rest and a warm meal does not mean you can fight past six people. No to mention what other Vagabonds are in the building.)

It goes about as well as last time. You are tied up again.

You jolt with every step Greg takes. It doesn’t take the group long to get where they’re going. Yon see enough from where you’re dangling over Greg’s shoulder to see when a flytecraft comes into view holy shit, the Vagabonds have  flytecraft!? And it works!? It sits idly, humming away, waiting for people to board.
