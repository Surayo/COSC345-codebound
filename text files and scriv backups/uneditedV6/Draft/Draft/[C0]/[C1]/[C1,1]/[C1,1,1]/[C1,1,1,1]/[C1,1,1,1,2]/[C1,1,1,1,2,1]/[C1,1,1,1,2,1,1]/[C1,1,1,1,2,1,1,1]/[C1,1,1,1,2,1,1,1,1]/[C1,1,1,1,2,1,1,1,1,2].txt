[1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2]”This is a top secret vagabond mission. It’s to do with my aspect. Apparently they’ve been looking for someone who can survive out where the Bioforms are for years now. 

“Who would have thunk it, eh? We always thought our Aspects were so useless but it’s what they’ve been looking for the entire goddamn time!” Eve grins at you while the girl with her continues to stare at you, impassive. 

“So what,” You say, “They want to live out in the wilderness? Is that it?” 

“I don’t know. I haven’t asked. Being a Vagabond got be away from that shitty fucking Factory so if they want me to go out and test my Aspect with Ellie-May then I fucking will.”

“Hi.” Ellie-May says, “Eve won’t stop talking about you.”

“What!” Eve says, “No, I don’t fuck you.” She shoves Ellie-May who just giggles and and keeps walking just out of Eve’s reach. Cute.

“Anyway,” Eve says turning back to you, “Ellie-May here can mimic other people’s aspects-”

“Some people’s Aspects.” Ellie-May interjects.

“-some people’s Aspects.” Eve continues, “So we’re going to see if she can become immune to toxins too.”

“You’re going to expose her to the toxins and see if she dies? Is that it?” You ask.

“No, stupid, She has a monitor on.” At this Ellie-May pulls out a small handheld device that you can see is wired into her arm. It’s what the doctor uses to check Bioform Polin levels in blood to determine if a patient is doomed or just caught a cold. 

“Huh.” You say. Smart.
