[0.b]What is Eve doing?


[C1]There is no point provoking this gang of bastards. You catch and hold your sisters eye before you turn around and walk away. There is always another route home.

[C2]”Eve?” You say, your sister tenses up as you call her out, “What are you doing with them?” The tall man who addressed you glances back at her, expression faintly curious. 

[C3]That fucking shit-head. What the hell is Eve doing with a bunch of traitorous rebels? Your hand clenches down on the flick knife in your pocket.
