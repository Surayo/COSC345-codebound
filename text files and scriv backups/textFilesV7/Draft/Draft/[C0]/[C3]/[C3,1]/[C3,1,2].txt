[3.1.2]The confusion, the slowed world, the pain - That must have been their aspects. Your heart is beating fast, fueled by adrenalin, but not nearly that sickening rapid-fire speed it was just a few seconds ago. Stupid. What just came over you?

“OK.” You breath out, calming yourself down. “Ok. I’m listening.”
