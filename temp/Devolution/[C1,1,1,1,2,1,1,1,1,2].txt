Eve continues, “Who would have thunk it, eh? We always thought our Aspects were so useless but it’s what they’ve been looking for the entire goddamn time!” Eve grins at you while the girl with her continues to stare at you, impassive.

“I don’t know. I haven’t asked. Being a Vagabond got me away from that shitty fucking Factory so if they want me to go out and test my Aspect with Ellie-May-” 

“Hi.” Ellie-May says, speaking for the first time.

“-then I fucking will.” Eve finishes.

“Eve won’t stop talking about you.” 

“What!” Eve says, “No, I don’t. Fuck you.” She shoves Ellie-May who just giggles and keeps walking just out of Eve’s reach. Cute.

“Anyway,” Eve says turning back to you, “Ellie-May here can mimic other people’s aspects-”

“Some people’s Aspects.” Ellie-May interjects.
