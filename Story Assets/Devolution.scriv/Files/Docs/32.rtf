\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. And I don\u8217\'92t want to know. If you could all just give up this little charade and come back, it would-\u8221\'94 you let out a frustrated sound. \u8220\'93The other workers would have it so much better.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rasputin motions for her to stop and you startle out of your tirade. You forgot to be scared of them for a second there. But Eve does that to you sometimes, frustrates you enough to start yelling.}

With your disposition you would go running to whatever authorities you think could do something to stop as and foil our plans.
