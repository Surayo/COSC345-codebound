It’s in the brief span of silence that you hear the footsteps coming up from behind you.

“[Name]?”

You turn, “Eve?” you ask.

“What are you doing out here?” she asks. You glance from her to the girl beside her. You can’t tell if she looks younger then you or not. She stares back, not saying anything.

“I - I lost your ring.” You say.

“What are you even talking about? What. Are you doing. Out Here!? Give me the why! You can’t lose a ring if you’re not out here in the first place.”

Despite her forceful voice she looks more concerned for you than angry that you lost her ring. You breathe out, stealing yourself, “I was looking for you. I can’t let you do this. The Vagabonds are - are…” You glance at the girl beside her again. She awkwardly looks away.

“Fuck off. I’m fine. Just, Just go home [Name]. I don’t have time for this.” 

“I can’t. I can’t just let you leave like that. Also, I don’t know where I am.” 

Eve groans. “Why are you like this. Shit. OK. You’re coming with us then.” She pulls you out of the dirt by the arm and dusts you off. “What were you ding on the ground anyway? Wait. You know what. I don’t care. Just shut up and come with us.”

She stomps off in a direction you are sure is the opposite of where you want to go.
