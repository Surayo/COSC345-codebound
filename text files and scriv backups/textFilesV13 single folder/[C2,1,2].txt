[2,1,2]”The first person we sent was my then second in command, Juniper. That was more then a year ago. We lost contact with her a few hours into her flight. A week after Juniper disappeared we sent a rescue party of 6 Vagabonds to try and retrieve her but they were met with the same fate, whatever that may be.” Rasputin frowns, looking up at the flytecraft sitting idle in front of you. “I would have sent more, but I don’t want to loose more of my people.”

Eve looks uncharacteristically somber, her eyes wide behind her large round glasses. “I didn’t know. I mean I knew something had happened to your previous second but I didn’t know that she had been… lost. Like that.”

“Yes well, as great as Boss is, she is no Juniper.”


[C2,1,2,1]”I’ll go after her.” You say. Rasputin glances your way, surprised. “I’ll find out where she went and bring her back.”

[C2,1,2,2]”Who’s Boss?” you ask. Rasputin gestures again and starts walking. “Let’s walk while we talk. I think you are ready to see where we base ourselves.”

[C2,1,2,3]”Don’t think this excuses anything.” You say, “You should still be working in the Factory, all of you should be.”
