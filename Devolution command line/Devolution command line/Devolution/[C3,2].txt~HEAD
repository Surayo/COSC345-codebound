[3.2]Almost immediately you feel the world go soft around you. The knife falls from your fingers and you feel your consciousness stretch apart and scatter. 

You stumble, your limbs disconnected.

You are awake but your thoughts are so far apart from each other that the world just exists around you with no effort on your part.

When your mind pulls itself back together you are being held up by multiple hands, your dropped knife gone.

“What?” you say.

“Now then.” Rasputin says to you. “What were you planning on doing with this.” He holds up the knife.

You gape at it, shocked at how fast the situation dissolved out of your control. “I…” you hesitate. What were you planning? Against this group of Vagabonds all with unknown Aspects you stood with your shitty toxicity immunity and a three inch blade. “I don’t know.” You finally say, lamely.

“Well, I’m glad we stopped you then.”

Eve interjects, “What the shit, [NAME]!? What is with you today? I know what I’m doing. You don’t have to follow me and keep me in line like you’re always trying to do. This doesn’t concern you.”

“It does though.” You say, conscious of your bubbling emotions. Eve always knows how to rile you up.
