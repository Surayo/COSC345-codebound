Ellie-May starts eating now that she isn’t the one talking to Rasputin.

“Uh, yeah.” You reply, ”It does. Though I don’t use it for that much. It’s not like I go out into the forest on a regular basis. I mostly use it in the furnace room to protect everyone from the soot and fumes.” 

Rasputin nods his head. “And that is precisely the point. Your Aspect has a range, it can cover multiple people. Eve can protect herself but we weren’t about to send her on her own.”

“Where exactly are we going? You said you had a flytecraft?” you ask.

“The where is a long story and to tell you the truth - I don’t know. And in regards to the flytecraft, it’s best I show you.”  He stands up. “Finish up your meals. You should be ready to leave in an hour.”

He turns to Eve, “And Eve. Round up Boss, Greg, and Patrick. Tell them the plans. I have more to organise before we leave.”

Eve salutes, “Can do.”

Rasputin leaves the three of you to your food and heads back out into the main hall. You go back to eating.
