[0.2]You hear that muffled noise again, loader and more distinct. Definitely voices. You hardly have time to freeze before a group of people walk out into the smog filtered daylight. They are Vagabonds. All of them. You know this immediately by the black stained clothes of their crew.

This time you stutter to a stop. Shit. This is a bad place to be caught. Your eyes flick from one face to another as they shaunter out of the alley. More than a dozen Vagabonds and one of you. Icy fear flows down your spine. They're rebels, no one knows exactly how dangerous they are but from the stories you've heard they are vicious in their cause. 

Most of them don't even glance your way. You grip the handy flick knife in your pocket and avoid the eyes of the trailing two Vagabonds that have taken notice of you. 

A tall sort of gaunt looking Vagabond looks at you frozen in place. "On your way, worker." he says, his words barely louder than the banter of the crew around him. Tense but relieved, You go to duck your head down and do as he says but a pair of familiar circular glasses eclipsing shocked wide eyes stop you. 

It can't be. Your sister.

What is Eve doing?

[C0.1]There is no point provoking this gang of bastards. You catch and hold your sisters eye before you turn around and walk away. There is always another route home.

[C0.2]"Eve?" You say, your sister tenses up as you call her out, "What are you doing with them?" The tall man who addressed you glances back at her, expression faintly curious. 

[C0.3]That fucking shithead. What the hell is Eve doing with a bunch of tratourious rebels. Your hand clenches down on the flick knife in your pocket.
