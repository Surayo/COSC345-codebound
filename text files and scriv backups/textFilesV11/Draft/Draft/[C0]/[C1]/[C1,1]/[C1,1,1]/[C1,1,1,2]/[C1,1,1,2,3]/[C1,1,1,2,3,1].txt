[1,1,1,2,3,1]”I’m looking for Eve. My sister? Do you know where I can find her?” you ask. The three Vagabonds got closer until you are almost in the middle of the group. They are all taller than you. You gulp nervously.

“Yeah we know ‘er. Didn’t expect to see you wanderin’ around these parts though, [Name]. We expected you to be asleep in bed, like a good little worker.” The skinniest asks - the one who first called out to you. 

“Ah. Right.” You say, ”Well I’m looking for Eve. I’m not quite sure why I though she’d be hear of all places but to be honest I have no idea where to find her.”

“We could take you to her if you like.” The woman says. “It’s not far back to our base. That’s where Eve is usually to be found.”

“I’m Patrick by the way.”The smaller, talkative man says, “That’s Greg.” He shoves a thumb at the hulking figure beside him.

“’Ello” Greg says in a deep voice.

“And that there’s our Boss.” The woman nods in acknowledgement.

“Just follow us then and we’ll take you to your sister.” She says. 


[C1,1,1,2,3,1,1]You follow them. It’s not as far as you would have thought to get back to the Vagabonds’ base.

[C1,1,1,2,3,1,2]”No, I-” you say. “We weren’t asking.” The Boss says. Greg grabs you roughly by the arms.
