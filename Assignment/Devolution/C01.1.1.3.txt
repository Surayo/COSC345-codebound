[01.1.1.3]The smog heavier in the air, more so then usual. The air is unnaturally still.

You walk with other workers but feel too tired to join in with their banter, your sisters absence sits heavy on your shoulders.

It sucks. Why did she have to abandon you like that? You've been together since your parents died years ago. She was a constant presence in your life and sure she has always been a little flighty but fuck. Why did she have to up and become a fucking Vagabond sympathizer?

Liaba glances back at you, "Where's your sister? Is she skipping out again." She asks, falling back from the group to walk with you.

You grumble something even you know isn't words and plod on, head down.

"Come on, [NAME]. Talk to me." She bumps into your side. "Did you two fight? I heard something last night waaay after your fucking bedtime."

"I don't want to talk about it." You don't want to have to lie to her but your sister left you for the fucking Vagabonds last night and you are trying not to stay pissed about it. 

"Hmmmmm. Alright. But you are moping way more then usual. If your sister has gotten into some shit again talk to me. Her stressing you out stresses me out and I'm not about that life."

Choices:

[C1.1.1.1.1.1]1. You give her a friendly punch on the shoulder. You feel better knowing she's there for you.
[C1.1.1.1.1.2]2. Dread and guilt washes over you. You should tell her. She's as much Eve's friend as your. She needs to know what Eve has done.
[C1.1.1.1.1.3]3. You pull Eve's ring out of your pocket. "Eve is gone." Liaba looks as you quizzically.
