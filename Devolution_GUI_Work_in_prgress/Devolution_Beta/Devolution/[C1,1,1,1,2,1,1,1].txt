[1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1]You sit there in the dirt. The night is utterly still as you sob. A rock is gripped in your hand, pressing into the wound there, but you don't care.

You hurt and you want to feel it.

You can feel the tear tracks falling down your cheeks and paw at your face with one clumsy hand smearing them. 

Your other hand holds the rock but no matter how hard you grip it, feeling it dig into your scraped up palm, the pain of losing your sister is greater.


[C1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1]Calm the fuck down already.

[C1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2]Don't. Continue the angst.
