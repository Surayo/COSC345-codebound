[2,2]Eve speaks up, “It’s not the only way you shitty little [XTHER]. Do you have any idea what we’re doing?”

“No. And I don’t want to know. If you could all just give up this little charade and come back, it would-” you let out a frustrated sound. “The other workers would have it so much better. There would be less pressure on the individual. I could work a fucking six hour shift instead of a fucking twelve!”

“That doesn’t matter-” Eve starts. 

Rasputin motions for her to stop and you startle out of your tirade. You forgot to be scared of them for a second there. But Eve does that to you sometimes, frustrates you enough to start yelling.

“It does matter.” Rasputin says. “I know the workers are tired. But it had to be done. But don’t worry. All the pieces are almost in place. Relief is coming.”

“Well that wasn’t cryptic or anything.” You say before you can think better of it.

Rasputin chuckles. “I can’t give the game away. With your disposition you would go running to whatever authorities you think could do something to stop as and foil our plans. What’s more important then what we’re doing, is why.”


[C2,1]”Why then.” You ask. He motions for you to follow. You follow.

[C2,2,1]”Why then.” You ask. He motions for you to follow. You don’t trust him in any way. “What? I’m not going with you.”

[C2,2,2]Whatever they’re planning maybe you can stop it right here and now. You thumb the flick knife in your pocket.
