[1.1.2.1.1.1.1.a]Only your hands are still tied. Patrick keeps unwinding the rope around your hands. “Almost, boss. I’m on watch tonight right? You two get some rest. I’ll make sure this one stays put till tomorrow.” 

The Boss grunts and steps over you just as the last piece of rope falls from your hands. You think about attacking them as Patrick stands up with a creak and a groan and ducks under Gregs arm to get out the door but decide against it. 

Your limbs are stiff and sore from being carried and even getting up off the floor is going to be an effort. 

The door clicks shut behind Greg and through the window Patrick calls out. “I’ll be on the other side of this door and I don’t fucking sleep so don’t think about trying nothin’.” 

Great.

You glance around and notice a cot behind you. It’s got blankets on it even though you probably won’t need them. It’s a long way away from the cold season.

You manage to haul yourself to your feet and flop down into it.

You have no idea what will happen in the morning, ahead of you stretches a field of unfathomable unknown bullshit. 

Before you can spiral too far into thoughts of ‘why you’ you fall asleep. It has been a long day.
