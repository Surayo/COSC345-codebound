\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You shiver and pull your work coat closer around yourself and peer both ways down the street. To the left lies The Factory, you know that path like the unwavering aftertaste of canned Nutritious Food Staple. To the right lies deeper parts of The Fringes, crumbling skyscrapers and the sprawling roads of a city long abandoned. }
