[1.1.1.1.3.2.2]You head towards home, walking as quietly as you can. You can almost hear the voices if you stop and strain to listen to them. Every time you do you adjust your path home, taking detours that lead you further away from the group of voices.

Luckily, they seem to be heading deeper into the Fringes away from your route home. You let out a sign of relief and stop once more to listen for them. They are so far away now that you can no longer hear them, even with how dead silent the night is. 

A bone deep tiredness has settled over you now. What were you thinking? Why did you run out after your sister like that? Stupid. This city is too vast and too unknown. There was no way you could have found her. 

Chances are there is some secret Vagabond passageway out to their hide-out you never would have stumbled upon anyway. 

And now, because you decided to run out after Eve, you just know you’re going to be even more exhausted than normal during work tomorrow.

You see a shadow shifting out of your periphery before you’re tackled to the hard pavement by a large shape. 

The wind is knocked out of you. You wheeze out a breath, stunned. The shape - a large man - is pressing you down into the pavement with his weight. 

You can’t breathe.

Two more shapes come into your line of sight - more people. “Whoop!” one of them says - a man, “We got ‘[Xm], boss. What are the chances, eh?” Fuck. Are these guys fucking Vagabonds?

You finally pull in a painful breath to shout, “Get the fuck off me!” - hoping someone will hear you. But you know you are still too far away from home. No one but Vagabonds would dare be out this far this late at night.
