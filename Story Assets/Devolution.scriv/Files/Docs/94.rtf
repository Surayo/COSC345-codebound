\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 [1,1,1,2,3,1,1]It doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t take you long to get to the Vagabonds hideout. Your group approaches a man leaning against a nondescript door. He nods to Boss. \u8220\'93I see the mission went well, Boss.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Better than expected,\u8221\'94 Boss says. She ducks past him through the door and you all follow. You\u8217\'92re pulled down a short entryway and through another door at the end. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re somewhat shocked to find the next room crawling with Vagabonds. Your eyes dart around, trying to take in all the people milling about. People in nightcaps and stripy pyjamas sit around with hot drinks in their hands while others in the usual black Vagabond clothes move around and through more doorways.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Your group marches forward through the throng and people seem to see Boss and part ways. You guess she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pretty high up in the ranks to hold that much respect. As if the name doesn\u8217\'92t give it away.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Boss pushes through one of the doors lining the walls and is greeted by a small office. You recognise the man behind the desk immediately.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greg pushes you to the front of the group so that you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re standing beside Boss. \u8220\'93Mission success.\u8221\'94 She says.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rasputin looks up. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Excellent. Right on schedule. I trust you didn\u8217\'92t give them too much trouble?\u8221\'94 he asks of you.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. I\u8230\'85 I guess not. Wait.\u8221\'94 You say shaking your head.  You turn to Boss, \u8220\'93Were you out looking for me? Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93On request of me of course,\u8221\'94 Rasputin says. \u8220\'93What matters is what you\u8217\'92re planning to do now. My vagabonds and I are in a difficult position. With you here, we could complete our sole purpose before tomorrows end. The question is whether you are willing to join us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m here to find my sister.\u8221\'94 You say. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah.\u8221\'94 Rasputin replies, leaning back in his chair, \u8220\'93Eve. Yes, fair enough. She\u8217\'92s out on a mission with Ellie-May. It\u8217\'92s a small matter. They should be back within the hour. You can see her then. But back to the point at hand; will you join us?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What exactly is your goal?\u8221\'94 You ask.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rasputin walks around the table, looking over at the far wall of the office. It sports a giant map of Fragos, from the city centre, to The Factory, to all edges of The Fringes. You see traces of tunnels you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve never seen before crossing under paths you walk everyday and detailed patterns of paths connecting well-marked points that reach as far as to the Bioforms start growing.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Our goal is to leave this city.\u8221\'94 He says. \u8220\'93We know there is something else out there - other people, even. Whatever it may be, it must be better than this wretched existence.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He turns back you, unknown emotions swirling through his eyes.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve been working in The Factory a while, yes? You\u8217\'92ve seen what it\u8217\'92s like. It\u8217\'92s hell down there - bitter endless hell. Whatever it is that\u8217\'92s out there, beyond the outer edges of Fragos, it must be better than staying here. And with you, we could find it. We could finally be free from this place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You hesitate, not sure what to say. You are somewhat taken aback. What can you do that all these other people can\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t? Why does he think you hold enough power to lead the people of Fragos to a better life?}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rasputin turns away from both you and the map and settles back into his chair behind the desk. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only question is, is whether you will help me. There are six hours until our next chance for escape. Will you join us?\u8221\'94 He asks from his seated position in front of you.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 [C1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1]\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94OK.\u8221\'94 You say, Rasputin lets out a breath and runs a hand through his hair.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 [C1,1,1,2,3,1,1,2]\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94I - No.\u8221\'94 You say. \u8220\'93What are you talking about. There is nothing out there for us - The Factory is our only chance.\u8221\'94}
