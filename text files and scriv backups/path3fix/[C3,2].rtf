\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You stumble, your limbs disconnected.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You are awake but your thoughts are so far apart from each other that the world just exists around you with no effort on your part.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When your mind pulls itself back together you are being held up by multiple hands, your dropped knife gone.}

What were you planning? Against this group of Vagabonds all with unknown Aspects you stood with your shitty toxicity immunity and a three inch blade. \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94 You finally say, lamely.}

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0

It is not that we don\u8217\'92t want to keep the city safe from the Bioforms, it is that we believe that there is a better way, an easier way, a way that would keep everyone safe while also freeing them from the toll The Factory takes on them.\u8221\'94}
