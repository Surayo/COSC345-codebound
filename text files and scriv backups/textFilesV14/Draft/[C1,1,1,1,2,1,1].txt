[1,1,1,1,2,1,1]Desperately you start searching the ground for Eve’s ring. Your hands hurt and you couldn’t give less of a fuck. You scrabble at the pavement. 

You gasp out a sob, scrabbling at the ground where you heard the ring fall. 

It hurts.

You sit back on the ground, gasping and lost.


[C1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1]Sit there.

[C1,1,1,1,2,1,2]Go home.
