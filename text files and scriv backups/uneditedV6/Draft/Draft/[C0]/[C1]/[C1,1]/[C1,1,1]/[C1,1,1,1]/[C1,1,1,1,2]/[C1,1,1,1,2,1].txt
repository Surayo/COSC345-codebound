[1.1.1.1.2.1]No sound jumps out at you, no twitch of movement calls your attention. Nothing. Your knees almost buckle on your next step.

Where is she?

You gasp and your eyes prick. You’ve slowed almost to a stop.

Where the fuck is she?

You can’t stop, you can’t. You have to find Eve. You can’t loose her. She is all you have left. If she leaves you too you’ll have nothing. You have to get to her. Eve is out here. 

You cling to her ring, a gift from you to fer. She’s has worn it since you both were kids even as her other jewelery changed. Why would she give it back?

How could she do this to you?

The only thing keeping you upright and moving at this point is your desperate anger - your bitter determination not to lose her too.

You stumble over a crack in the sidewalk and almost fall. You gasp in a breath, blinking as your eyes blur over. The unfamiliar buildings tower over you. 

You are completely and utterly lost and it’s all her fault. How could she?

Fuck her. And fuck you for letting her fuck you over like this.

Your eyes are blurring too much so see the street in front of you. You blindly stumble on. It’s no surprise when you trip.

You hit the ground hard, on hands and knees, and feel the palms of your hands tear. Eve’s Ring goes flying out into the street.
