[1,1,2,2]You freeze, your eyes wide. 

“Quiet and we won’t hurt you.” A hushed male voice says. Another shadow looms over the firsts shoulder. Your blood is thrumming through your head, dread pooling in your stomach but you manage to nod into the hand covering your mouth. “Good.”

He uncovers your mouth only for the second figure to shove a balled up piece of cloth into your mouth a second later. You let them, and shake. What the fuck? What is even happening? Are you being kidnapped or something?

“[Xe]’s being awfully quite don’t you think, Greg?” the second figure says. The first one grunts and holds you still by the shoulders even as you don’t struggle against him. “I was expecting a real fight with this one but I guess you can never really tell. Not even making a peep or nothin’!” 

“I wish you would take [Xis] queue, Patrick.” A female voice says from over near the door. How many of these guys are there? It suddenly dawns on you that these must be Vagabonds and you feel yourself tense up with renewed fear. What the fuck do the Vagabonds want with you that they’ll go to all the trouble of kidnapping you over it?

“Right you are, Boss.” Patrick replies in a quieter, yet no less enthusiastic, voice. He ties the gag in place with another strip of cloth. 

Patrick pulls out rope next and makes deft work of tying your hands and feet. “Hey, Greg. Have you got they rucksack?” Patrick asks of the larger man looming over you.

Greg pulls a black bag out of his coat and hands it over. 

“’Preciate it, Greg.” He pulls it over your head, blocking out the dim light around you and your sight with it.

“Let’s get going, boys.” The boss says. “We have to get back to base and report this astounding success to Rasputin.”

“Right you are.” Patrick says. “You got ‘[Xm], Greg?” 

Greg hefts you up onto his shoulder and you settle with an ‘oof’ in place. “Got ‘[Xe].”
