\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 [3,1,2]The confusion, the slowed world, the pain - That must have been their Aspects. Your heart is beating fast, fuelled by adrenaline, but not nearly that sickening rapid-fire speed it was just a few seconds ago. Stupid. What just came over you?}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93OK.\u8221\'94 You breathe out, calming yourself down. \u8220\'93OK. I\u8217\'92m listening.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you know why your sister defected?\u8221\'94 Rasputin asks.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You seethe but manage to hold the anger in. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94 Your heart is still pounding faster than it ought to be and you resist the instinct to struggle against the remaining hands on you.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She asked us why we were fighting. She asked us what our cause was. And when she found out, she asked how she could help. The answer to that was simple in her case. She has the most intriguing Aspect, you see, as I assume you know quite well. That, my dear [Name], is why Eve defected.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re quiet for a second. Eve has always been more curious than is healthy, always pulling you into trouble, going where she shouldn\u8217\'92t go. But she is also smart. Smarter than you if you\u8217\'92re being honest (Which you may as well be seeing as it\u8217\'92s your own head). }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What was your answer?\u8221\'94 you finally ask. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rasputin smiles, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re mot ready for that. Go home little [Xoy]\u8221\'94}
