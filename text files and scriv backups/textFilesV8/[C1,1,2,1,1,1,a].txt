[1.1.2.1.1.1.a]“Well you can’t blame me for pointing out the truth. I wish my aspect was as strong as that. Mine just keep me awake! Which, you know, I don’t really mind as such. It’s real handy for the long shifts when we need important jobs like this done.

Either of those aspects sounds great to you - strength or whatever weird insomnia aspect Patrick has. All you have is fucking ‘immune to toxins’.
