[1.1.2.1.2.a]You barley see her move before she grabs your flailing wrist in her strong grip. You tug but she doesn’t budge, she just pulls your other arm out of Patrick’s hold and pulls you to your feet, crushing your back against her front. “Get the rucksack on [Xer].” She says to Patrick who has found himself suddenly bereft of a job.

You struggle against her grip but she just holds you tighter, digging her fingers into the skin of your arms. No. You can’t let her win. You heave in a breath through your nose and redouble your attempt to get free. 

“Right you are, boss. I’ll just get it from Greg.” The boss grunts on affirmation from behind you, easily keeping up with your struggles to escape. Even when you stomp your full weight onto her foot she doesn’t budge. 

You are surprised when Greg manages to uncurl from his protective ball and pull a dirty black bag out from his pocket. “Here.” He hands it to Patrick who stumbles back over to where you are still struggling against the boss lady and promptly pulls it over your head. 

It immediately cuts out the weak light that had been filtering into the room. The sack pulled tight around your neck and you choke. “Got ‘[Xm].” Patrick’s voice says muffled through the cloth. “Fucking balls [Xe] was a tough one. Looking at [Xer] I wouldn’t think [Xe] had it in ‘[Xm].” You wheeze out a harsh breath, exhausted even as you continue to struggle.

Your hands are pulled tight behind your back and secured tightly with a piece of rope before you can even try to slip free. Then suddenly you are falling forward and hit the mattress with an ‘oof’. More rope is tied around your ankles. Fuck.

Someone hauls you onto their shoulders - Greg from the size of him - and starts walking.

“You ‘ight Greg. [Xe] gave you a real walloping back there.” Says Patrick.

“I’ll live.” Greg grunts.
