[1.1.1.1.3.2.2.a]Apart from your stupid fucking ass.

“Get the gag, Patrick. We have no time to waste.” A woman’s voice says - the third Vagabond. 

You are so fucked. “No! Get off - mmmmmph!” While the first man still crushes you, muffling your yelling by virtue of the weight pressing on your lungs - the other man pulls out a foul smelling cloth and stuffs it in your open mouth. 

You thrash and try to push the cloth out but he ties another one around your mouth, keeping the first in place.

“Great work with that tackle, Greg. Truly astounding if I do say so myself.” The second man - Patrick - says, tying the gag off with a sharp tug that digs into your skin. You wince.

“All in a days work.” The man on top of you says. You thrash but his hold on you is too solid and your already tired body is worn out after running off into the night like you did.

“Which pocket is the rucksack in, Greg? I can never remember where you shove things in the big coat of yours.” Your mind is whirring, trying to think of a way to escape. One of your hands isn’t pinned under you and you claw at the gag.

“Bottom right.” Greg says, he pulls your hand away from your face by the wrist and when you manage to pull your other arm free from under you he grabs that too. Patrick riffles through Greg’s coat and pulls out a black bag which he promptly shove over your head and pulls tight. It’s musty and unpleasantly warm. 

“Well, this was easier then I expected.” The woman says. “And to think we thought we missed [Xer] too. What are the chances we would stumble upon [Xer] on the way back home after calling the mission a failure. Rasputin will be amused.”

Greg shifts his weight off of you, pulling you up by your wrists which he still has gripped tight in his fists. He has pulled you up so high your feet don’t touch the ground.
