[1.1]Your sister appears in the doorway looking as angry as you are. She opens her mouth to retort but you aren't finished. "Dad didn't work his fucking bones to the ground for you to skive off work to go hang out with rebel scum like them. Did you even fucking stop to consider who you were hurting?" 

"You don't know what you're talking about, [NAME]. Do you even have any idea who I was with!? No. if course not. You don't think."

"Yes I fucking do. You're the one-"

She stomps over to where you are sitting at the table, hands fisted. "Shut your shitting mouth, no you don't. The vagabonds aren't the bad guys!"

You groan and thump your head down on the table. "Why do you have to be like this. Can't you just sit down and shut up for once in your life. Working in the The Factory protects us and the Vagabonds refuse to work. Them not working just makes it harder for the rest of us." 

"The Factory is a shit-hole" She mutters. 

"We would die if it wasn't for the factory!" You say. She rolls her eyes at your words and pushes her glasses further up her nose.

"That's what they want you to think." She says smuggly. What. What does that even mean? "We'll I'm not going back. I'm going to get out of this shitty town and when I do i'll never have to work in that dump-hole ever again." She extends her middle finger towards you.
