[1.1.2.1.1.1.1]You are dumped on the ground surprisingly gently by Greg. The sack is pulled off your head and you squint against the sudden light. You are in a dark windowless room with a heavy metal door guarding the only way in or out. It’s currently open but Greg positions his bulk in the doorway in its stead.

“Alright pipsqueak lets get these ropes off ‘a you.” Patrick says. He starts untying you, starting with the foul tasting gag in your mouth. 

As soon as the gag is out you speak. “What do you want with me.”

“Eh?” Patrick asks, working on untying your feet next. “Don’t look at me. I don’t fuckin’ know. What about you Greg? Do you know?” He asks behind him.

Greg shrugs and glances behind you. You look up to see the women they call ‘Boss’ standing behind you.

“Don’t worry about that right now. Rasputin will be down to check on you soon enough. If you’re lucky he will tell you then.”

“How can you tell be not to worry. You fucking kidnapped me. I’m here for some shady fucking reason-. Do you honestly think that after all this I’m going to help you guys with-. With whatever the fuck it is you want from me?”

“Listen I don’t ask questions.” Patrick says tugging you towards him by your hands. You were talking at the Boss but she looks like she’s happy for Patrick to take this one. “They just point me in a direction and I go. You might not trust us right now but you’re gonna understand one of these days that we are on the right side of this.”

“He’s right you know.” Greg says. “We’re gonna save everyone.”

“Are you almost done there Patrick.” The Boss says. “It’s late and I still need to report to Rasputin.”
