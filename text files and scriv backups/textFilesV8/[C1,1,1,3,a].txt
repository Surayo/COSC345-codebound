[1.1.1.3.a]Liaba glances back at you, “Where’s your sister? Is she skipping out again.” She asks, falling back from the group to walk with you.

You grumble something even you know isn’t words and plod on, head down.

“Come on, [NAME]. Talk to me.” She bumps into your side. “Did you two fight? I heard something last night waaay after your fucking bedtime.”

“I don’t want to talk about it.” You don’t want to have to lie to her but your sister left you for the fucking Vagabonds last night and you are trying not to stay pissed about it. 

“Hmmmmm. Alright. But you are moping way more than usual. If your sister’s gotten into some shit again talk to me. Her stressing you out stresses me out and I’m not about that life.”


[C1.1.1.1.1.1]You give her a friendly punch on the shoulder. You feel better knowing she’s there for you.

[C1.1.1.1.1.2]Dread and guilt washes over you. You should tell her. She’s as much Eve’s friend as yours. She needs to know what Eve has done.

[C1.1.1.1.1.3][I1]You pull Eve’s ring out of your pocket. “Eve is gone.” Liaba looks at you quizzically.
