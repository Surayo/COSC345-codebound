[1,1,1,3,1,2]You get a grip on her arm, slowing the both of you down. She must see something concerning in your expression because she goes serious, waiting for you to talk. 

You let out a breath and lower your voice so the people around you won’t hear. “Eve joined the Vagabonds.” You say.

Liaba stops. “What!” she says louder than you would like. A few people look over.

“Shhhhh.” You say, “That’s what all the ruckus was about last night. I was trying to stop her. She wouldn’t listen.”

“Oh my god.” Liaba says, marginally quieter than before.

The crowd has gotten thicker around you as more workers arrive from other houses. Someone pushes in between the two of you.

“Oh my god!” Liaba says again. “Eve!?”

“Yeah, Eve.” You say, glancing over.

Oh.

It’s Eve. She’s standing between the two of you, grinning in your direction.

“That’s my name.” She says. She grabs you by the arm pulling you away from where Liaba is still gaping at her. “Can I talk to you for a second?” She doesn’t wait for an answer. Just pulls you away from the crowd and into a side alley.


[C1,1,1,3,1,1,1]”Wait.” You say pulling your arm out of her grip. She groans.

[C1,1,1,3,1,1,2]”What are you doing back?” you ask, finishing your thought from before, now that she’s finished moving you.
