He stands up. \u8220\'93What matters is what you\u8217\'92re planning to do now. My Vagabonds and I are in a difficult position. With you here, we could complete our sole purpose before tomorrows end. The question is whether you are willing to join us.\u8221\'94 Eve has stepped back with Ellie-May, letting Rasputin address you fully. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What exactly is your goal?\u8221\'94 You ask.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rasputin walks around the table, looking over at the far wall of the office. It sports a giant map of Fragos, from the city centre, to The Factory, to all edges of The Fringes. You see traces of tunnels you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve never seen before crossing under paths you walk everyday and detailed patterns of paths connecting well-marked points that reach as far as to the Bioforms start growing.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Our goal is to leave this city.\u8221\'94 He says. \u8220\'93We know there is something else out there - other people, even. Whatever it may be, it must be better than this wretched existence.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He turns back you, unknown emotions swirling through his eyes.}

It\u8217\'92s hell down there - bitter endless hell. Whatever it is that\u8217\'92s out there, beyond the outer edges of Fragos, it must be better than staying here. And with you, we could find it. We could finally be free from this place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You hesitate, not sure what to say. You are somewhat taken aback. What can you do that all these other people can\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t? Why does he think you hold enough power to lead the people of Fragos to a better life?}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rasputin turns away from both you and the map and settles back into his chair behind the desk. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only question is, is whether you will help me. There are six hours until our next chance for escape. Will you join us?\u8221\'94 He asks from his seated position in front of you.}
