[1,1,1,1,3,1,2,2]The laser handgun explodes in your face blasting a hole through your skull. The gun falls from your slack grip, hitting the floor with a clatter of metal. Your body wavers for a second, then follows it.

You lay prone on the floor, the hole in your skull has been cauterised by the laser and does not bleed.

You are dead.
