[3]”What the fuck, Eve!?” you shout. “I can’t believe you’ve done this. After all we’ve been through together.”

“You know this [Xoy], Eve?” the tall man directs to Eve. 

Her eyes haven’t left yours but she ignores your shouted question to answer his. “Yeah I do, Rasputin. [Name]’s my shitty little [Xther].” Her shock has turned to disgruntled annoyance.

“Piss off!” Eve yells back, finally breaking eye contact to turn her back on you in dismissal.


[C3,1]You pull the knife on Eve and aim for the throat in a blind sweep of rage.

[C3,2]You pull the knife on Eve, but hesitate. She’s your sister. No mater what she’s done she won’t stop being your sister.

[C1]You fuck off, seething. It isn’t worth causing a scene here. There are too many Vagabonds for you to win this fight.
