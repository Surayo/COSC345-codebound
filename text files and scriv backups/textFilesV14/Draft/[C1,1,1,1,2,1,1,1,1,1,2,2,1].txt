[1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,1]You groan, a headache pounding in your head. Your on a mattress in a dark room. 

God. Fuck. What did you do last night? 

You squint into the darkness but you don’t recognise the room. Are you even in The House?

The door on the other side of the room opens with a loud groan revealing a skinny looking dude you’re never seen before and a hallway you don’t recognise. 

Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. You remember now. You were out looking for Eve and… Did she knock you out? Her own [Xther]? The Vagabonds have corrupted her more than you thought.

“’Ello, there [name]. Now, you may be wondering what is happening right now, and with fair reasoning. I’m Patrick, and I will be your captor this morning.”

He’s carrying a plate of something steaming. He pulls a panel down from the wall, turning it into a table shelf thing held up by chains and places on it a plate of what looks like surprisingly good quality re-hydrated food. 

“Eat quickly. We have a big day ahead of us.” He says, shutting the door behind him as he leaves.


[C1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1]You have hardly finished eating when six people enter your cell, Rasputin at the forefront.
