\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But you are also starving and so redirect your efforts to scarfing down some canned Nutritious Food Staple. The action of sitting upright and eating takes the rest of the post-work wind out of you and so you let your eyes drift closed right there at the table. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The sound of the front door clicking shut startles you out of your doze. Soft padding steps pass through the front hall. You blink the fog out of your eyes and rub at your slightly aching jaw. Lying sprawled out over the table isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the best position to fall asleep in.}

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The footsteps stop and a quiet \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shit\u8221\'94 breaks the stillness of The House. Yep. That\u8217\'92s your sister, alright. \u8220\'93Go back to sleep.\u8221\'94 her harsh whisper calls back to you.}
