[1.1.2.3]You bite hard into the hand covering your mouth and taste blood. The man yelps, startlingly high pitched. “[Xe] bit me.” He says.

“Oi! That’s rude you piece of fuck.” A second male voice says from closer to the bed than you would like. You let out a shout of alarm and push yourself backwards away from the two attackers. 

“Shhhhhhh!” a female voice says from closer to the door, sounding angry. “Keep it down. We don’t want to be caught.” 

Yes you fucking do. You shout out a strangled “Help!” before the same large hands are closing over your mouth. 

“Stop.” The man holding your mouth closed says. You strain and scratch at his hands. You hear and loud thud coming from the room next to yours and a voice muffled through the walls. 

“Shit, boss. Abort?” the second male says, backing away from you.

“Agreed. There are more people waking up.” The woman says. “Let’s get out of here before the whole building comes down on us.” 

The first and largest assailant immediately lets go of you and sprints out the door, his footfalls surprisingly light for his large frame. The second man falls back almost as quickly, stumbling over himself on the way out the door and then all three of them are gone, leaving the door clicked shut behind them.

Fuck. You breathe, feeling you face over for bruises.

Fuck.
