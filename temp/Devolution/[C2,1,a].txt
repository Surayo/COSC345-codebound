[2.1.a]Then, as you walk further out, you spot it, growing in the cracks of a building - A Bioform.

You take a half step back. The Bioforms are everything your community has ever feared. They are why you work so hard - you pump out smog to keep the Bioforms out of your sanctuary, Fragos, your city. For Bioforms to be growing here you must have come right out to the edge of the smogs killing reach. 

The tiny patches of flora you notice as you pass won’t produce enough pollen to kill anyone in these low numbers, and you and your sister have nothing to fear yourselves, but this must be why the other Vagabonds hung back. Bioforms are terrifying for a person who isn’t immune. Their presence means death.

“I don’t get it. What does the edge have to do with the rations?” you ask. 

Rasputin doesn’t turn back towards you to reply, and you sister just smirks, a knowing glint in her eye.

Patches of green grow on almost all of the buildings now and the air is starting to clear up from the smog heavy air you are used to. You breathe in deep and smell pollen. It’s something you haven’t smelled in a long time.

You wonder if Rasputin has an Aspect similar to yours and your sisters? Your Aspects make you immune to the toxins. It protects you from the Bioforms’ poison. Most people would die if they breathed in the sickly sweet scent for too long. 

“Is your Aspect like ours?” you ask. You fall into step next to Rasputin and Eve. Eve scoffs as Rasputin shakes his head. 

“My Aspect lets me sense importance. That is how I found this place - it had a huge swell of importance hanging over it.” He gestures as you come up to an empty crumbling lot, “And that is how I found Eve.” 

This is the first wide open space you have seen in a while. There are Bioforms growing all over the place, poking through the cracks and along rusted wire fences, a smear of green, vivid as poison against the grey tones of the city.
