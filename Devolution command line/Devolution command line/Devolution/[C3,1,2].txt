[3,1,2]The confusion, the slowed world, the pain - That must have been their Aspects. Your heart is beating fast, fuelled by adrenaline, but not nearly that sickening rapid-fire speed it was just a few seconds ago. Stupid. What just came over you?

“OK.” You breathe out, calming yourself down. “OK. I’m listening.”

“Do you know why your sister defected?” Rasputin asks.

Rasputin smiles, “Good question. But I think it best if I show you.”

[C3,1,2,2]”Fuck that. I’m not going anywhere with you.” You say.
