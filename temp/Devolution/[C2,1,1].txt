[2.1.1]”Go get the others.” Rasputin says to Eve. She nods and peels off from your party. You hesitate, not wanting to be alone with Rasputin. He arches an eyebrow at the look you are giving him then head off after the Robots himself.

You follow.

The first thing the Robots do is head underground. They dip down into the gloom of an old subway system and disappear out of sight. “They don’t surface again until they return to the ship.” Rasputin says. 

“I still want to see for myself.” He nods at your words.

“Your sister was the same way - lacking trust. It’s admirable. I know you are committed to doing the right thing.”

“Yeah I’m still not sure on that. Like the Flytecraft is cool and all but why exactly is it important? The Factory still needs to run if we want to keep out people alive.”

“Ah, I should have explained further. What is important about the Flytecraft isn’t that it still exists. It is that if it exists, that means that there are people on the other side who survived the pandemic. Not only that, wherever they are, they are thriving. Now I only want what’s best for this city and I believe that if we can transport everyone from here to wherever there is, everyone will be better off.”

Suddenly the connection is clear to you. He is desperately trying to find out where the food is coming from, because wherever there is, you will thrive. You get it. Why just survive when you could all live in prosperity?
